Ala Moana Beach Park,"Ala Moana Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama), located between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu, is a favorite beach among local residents. Often times less crowded than Waikiki Beach, Ala Moana is a great place to swim, picnic, stroll on the beach or to relax.The beach is over half a mile long and the water is calm because it's protected by a shallow outer coral reef. There are hardly ever any waves, which makes Ala Moana Beach a favorite spot for long-distance swimmers, stand-up paddleboarders, novice swimmers and families with children. Recently installed buoys in the water mark the area for stand-up paddleboarders (it's the area closest to the offshore reef). The area closer to the beach is for swimmers. Back in the 1920s, Ala Moana Beach Park didn't exist. It was a wetland that the city used as a garbage dump. A boat channel, which was to connect the Ala Wai Boat Harbor with Kewalo Basin was dredged through the coral reef. The beach itself is also man-made. It was created by the owner of the Dillingham Dredging Company, who was looking for a place to deposit his dredged earth. In the 1950s, the company dumped sand at the park, which created the beach. The dredged channel is 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) deep. Today, boats no longer pass through it. The nearshore ocean bottom at Ala Moana Beach drops quickly, so novice swimmers should be cautious. To avoid stepping on the sharp corals, most people prefer the east end of the beach (the one that's closer to Diamond Head) where the ocean bottom is sandy and has no reef or rocks. The middle section and west end of the beach has rocks on the nearshore ocean bottom, which makes entering the ocean more tricky. The 100-acre park has large grassy areas, banyan and palm trees, restrooms, showers, concession stands, a music pavilion, tennis courts and plenty of picnic tables. Ala Moana Beach Park is a good place to go jogging, picnicking, playing games, sunbathing, fishing, swimming, surfing, stand-up paddleboarding and relaxing. Some of the south shore's best surf spots are located just offshore, such as Big Rights, Big Lefts, Concessions, Bomboras and Courts. Lifeguards are stationed on the beach daily.

Army Beach,"Now you may wonder why a beach in Hawaii would be called Army Beach (view panorama) . The name doesn't exactly sound Hawaiian. Well, this beach was named for a military recreation center that was located here from 1970 to 1989. A surf site offshore bears the same name.   Army Beach is located on Oahu's northwestern shore, across from the entrance to the Dillingham Airfield. It is near the end of Farrington Highway and at the beginning of the Ka'ena Point State Park. The beach is backed by the Waianae Mountains and is quite scenic. It is a long, sandy beach with azure blue waters. The ocean bottom is mainly rocky with a coral reef, but there is a small reef-free area that's ideal for a dip into the ocean if you would like to swim. Surfing is also possible here. In the winter months (November to March), the waves can reach heights of 15+ feet (4.5+ m), so this is no time for swimming. When the surf is up, strong currents make entering the ocean too dangerous.     ",,"surfing, swimming, fishing, snorkeling",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/armybeach.php
Banzai Pipeline,"Located on Oahu's North Shore, Banzai Pipeline (view panorama) is a popular surf site where waves can reach heights of 20+ feet (6+ m) in the winter months (November to February).Many big wave surfing contests take place here, and people from all over the world - professional surfers as well as spectators and photographers - come here to see the waves.   The Pipeline was named in 1961 by a California surfing movie producer, Bruce Brown. He visited Oahu's North Shore and was scouting possible movie locations together with two California surfers, Mike Diffenderfer and Phil Edwards. They stopped at this yet unnamed surf site and Brown filmed the surfers catching several waves. They all agreed that the surf site needed a name. On the same day, a construction project on the highway next to the beach (Kamehameha Highway) was going on. An underground pipeline needed to be fixed. Diffenderfer suggested they name this surf spot ""the Pipeline."" In 1961, Brown made this name popular in his new movie Surfing Hollow Days. At that time, the beach fronting the surf site was called Banzai Beach. But today, it is better known as Banzai Pipeline.

Barber's Point Beach Park (Kalaeloa),"Barber's Point Beach Park is most known for its lighthouse. The small sandy beach is mainly used by fishermen and picnickers because the swimming conditions are poor.There is a low limestone shelf along most of the shoreline which makes entering the ocean difficult. This, as well as strong currents, make this a no-swimming beach. The beach park is located on Oahu's leeward coast (at the southwestern tip) near Campbell Industrial Park. It is not the most scenic area on the island.   Barber's Point is named after Captain Henry Barber. In 1796, Barber arrived on Oahu in the Arthur. After loading supplies in Honolulu, he wanted to sail to Kauai and then on to China. But he ran aground at Oahu's southwestern tip, known as Kalaeloa, which means “the long point” in the Hawaiian language. After this incident, this area became known as Barber's Point.

Camp Erdman Beach,"Located on Oahu's northwestern shore, Camp Erdman (view panorama) is a long white-sand beach that marks the end of Farrington Highway.Just beyond this beach, the highway turns into a dirt road. The beach is named after Harold R. Erdman (1905-1931). The camp is mainly used as a summer camp for children and year-round for retreats and workshops.   In 1926, the YMCA leased these 10 beachfront acres from Walter Dillingham and built this camp on it. Walter Dillingham was the uncle of Harold R. Erdman, who died in a horseback riding accident in 1931. After his death, his mother Marion Dillingham Erdman requested that the camp be named in memory of her son.

Chun's Reef,"Chun's Reef is a popular surf site on Oahu's North Shore. There is a long stretch of sandy beach that begins here and ends at Kawailoa Beach to the east. The beach is located right next to Kamehameha Highway. The surf site is named after John Chun, a former resident in this area, who owned a house in nearby Kawailoa. His children liked to surf, but preferred this surf site over the site in front of their house, called Leftovers. A family friend eventually named the surf site where the Chun kids liked to surf Chun's Reef and since that time (the 1960s) it is known as Chun's.

Diamond Head Beach Park,"Diamond Head Beach Park (view panorama) is located on the foothills of Diamond Head, an extinct volcanic crater at the eastern end of Waikiki. The park includes two acres of sea cliffs on the south slope of the crater between Beach Road and the Diamond Head Lighthouse.   The beach here is narrow and fronted by a rocky shelf. The swimming conditions are poor because of the coral reef, but surfers find an uncrowded paradise here compared to Waikiki Beach. Snorkeling is also good if the waves aren't too high. Diamond Head Beach is also a popular tidepool excursion site.    ",,"surfing, snorkeling, fishing, tidepooling",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/diamondheadbeachpark.php
Ehukai Beach Park,"Raging waters, towering surf and massive waves that shake the shores. Ehukai Beach Park (view panorama) on Oahu's North Shore is a daredevil's dream, with waves reaching heights of over 30 feet (9 m) during the winter months (November to February).It's no wonder the beach is one of the most famous surf spots in the world - and as you might expect, also one of the most dangerous.   In the winter, adventurous surfers come to Ehukai to surf the massive waves that form tubes as they break. From the shore, it makes for an undeniably splendid view. But the real spectacle is the surfers who dare to ride these waves. Not all of them succeed, of course - let's just say the Ehukai lifeguards have become well-trained at treating broken bones. Surfing contests take place here, for example the 2013 Volcom Pipe Pro, which was held in January/February 2013 (see photos). The beach is a lot calmer from May to September, often times as calm as a lake. This is when swimming is possible here. The trees lining the shore also provide shade for picnics.

Ewa Beach Park,"Ewa Beach Park (see more photos) is the main beach in the residential community of the same name – Ewa Beach. The five-acre park is fronted by a narrow sandy beach. It is a popular swimming and picnicking location among local residents.The beach is also a good spot to gather edible seaweed, called limu in Hawaiian.   Ewa means “strayed” in the Hawaiian language. The name comes from an ancient Hawaiian legend, which tells of two gods, Kane and Kanaloa. As they traveled around Oahu they decided to throw a stone to mark the boundaries of the different land divisions. Wherever a stone fell would be the border of two land divisions. They were unable to find the stone that they threw on the island's wide plain west of Pearl Harbor, so they named this area Ewa (“strayed”) for the stone that strayed.

Hale'iwa Ali'i Beach Park,"Located west of the Hale'iwa Small Boat Harbor, this 19-acre beach park is a favorite gathering spot among North Shore residents.There is a large grassy area with plenty of room for a picnic. A recreation center named Kalili Surf Center is located in the park.   A popular surf site called Hale'iwa is located offshore. Beginners usually stick closer to shore, while experts ride the higher waves further out. A few surfing contests take place here in the winter months, when the surf on Oahu's North Shore is up. There are also a few good dive sites offshore, such as the Hale'iwa Trench. Swimming is possible here, but the conditions are fair because the ocean bottom is rocky. The beach park is more suitable for surfing, kayaking, boating, fishing and diving.

Swimming isn't that good here because of the shallow and rocky ocean bottom, but the park is nice for picnics.   Also, Hale'iwa Beach Park is frequently used by canoe paddlers as a training and regatta site and by kayakers as an access point to the bay.

Halona Beach Cove,"Halona Beach Cove (see more photos, view panorama) is a small pocket of sand located on the southeastern shore of Oahu.It was made popular in the movie From here to Eternity, filmed here in 1953, where it was a love scene of a couple (Burt Lancester and Deborah Kerr). Because of the movie, the beach was nicknamed Eternity Beach.   It is located on the right (west) side of the Halona Blowhole overlook. You have to hike down the rocks from there to get to it. Be careful and always wear shoes because the rocks are slippery, steep and sharp. The best time to swim in this small cove is when the water is calm. However, don't swim too far out because strong, dangerous currents are often times present and the water is very turbulent further out. Since there are no lifeguards stationed here, it is not recommended to get into the water if the surf is up. Also, stay away from the rocky areas. The rocky point to the west of the beach cove is called Bamboo Ridge. It has been a popular fishing spot since the 1920s. The location was named after the fishermen's bamboo fishing poles that could be seen along the edge of the cliff in the past. There are no facilities at Halona Beach Cove.

Hanauma Bay,"Ever fancied swimming amidst some of the world's rarest marine wildlife? It can't get much better than at Hanauma Bay (view panorama, see more photos), located on Oahu's southeastern shore near Hawaii Kai. Named America's best beach in 2004, Hanauma Bay is a longtime favorite among snorkelers and marine enthusiasts. It is home to over 450 kinds of tropical fish, many of which can only be found in Hawaii. Here you can observe marine life up close, including the humuhumunukunukuapua‘a, the Hawaiian state fish. Feeding, chasing or touching the fish and turtles is not allowed, but you can swim alongside them and take pictures. You can rent snorkeling gear from the nearby shops, and lifeguards are more than willing to assist beginners.   Although often called a beach park, Hanauma Bay is actually a nature preserve established to protect the delicate ecosystems in the bay. Visitors have to watch a short educational video about the bay's history and wildlife before entering the beach. A steep, but paved road leads down to it. If you don't feel like walking or have a physical disability, there's a shuttle bus that takes people to the beach (a nominal fee applies). If you forgot to bring your own food, there's a concession stand at the entrance of the bay. There's also a gift shop and shower facilities. Non-residents of the state of Hawaii have to pay an admission fee of $25 to enter Hanauma Bay. This fee is waved for Hawaii residents, active military and children under 13. There is a parking fee ($3 per vehicle for non-residents and $1 per vehicle for Hawaii residents). The beach opens at 6:45 a.m. every day, except Mondays and Tuesdays when it is closed. If you are planning to visit Hanauma Bay, it is recommended to reserve your tickets in advance. The online reservation system can be accessed at https://pros8.hnl.info/ Only a limited amount of walk-in or drive-in tickets without an online reservation is available. Hawaii residents may access Hanauma Bay without a reservation from 6:45 a.m. to 9 a.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. Residents arriving after 9:00 a.m. need a reservation or walk-in ticket. (Hanauma Bay isn't safely accessible on foot, and the city bus service to Hanuama Bay has been permanently discontinued). Special Note: Hanauma Bay is the top site on Oahu for drownings. Although the bay is protected by a reef and the nearshore waters are usually calm, Hanauma Bay is considered one of the deadliest beaches in Hawaii. According to the State Department of Health, 15 people died here between 2009 and 2014. A total of 47 people have drowned at Oahu's most popular snorkeling spot since 1995. Keep this in mind when planning a trip to Hanauma Bay. Always go snorkeling together with a buddy and stay together at all times. If you are not an experienced open ocean swimmer, stay close to the shore and don't swim out of the channel at Hanauma Bay (the channel that leads into deeper waters behind the reef).

Hau'ula Beach Park,"Hau'ula Beach Park on Oahu's windward coast is a popular camping and picnicking site among local residents. There is only a very narrow beach, and because of a shallow nearshore reef, the swimming conditions are poor. However, snorkeling is possible when the ocean is calm. Also, a beginners' surf spot is located offshore at the northern end of the park. Hau'ula, meaning ""red hau"" in the Hawaiian language, was named for the hau flowers, the native Hibiscus tiliaceus, which bloom in the summer months.

Hukilau Beach Park,"Hukilau Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is located in the little town of La'ie on Oahu's northeastern shore.It is a section of the long sand beach that runs between La'ie and Kalani Points. Swimming is good here during the summer. In the winter time when the surf is up, watch out for strong currents.   A “hukilau” in Hawaiian is a traditional method of fishing, in which a group of people participate. “Hukilau” literally means “pull a lau,” which is a rope with ti leaves attached to it. In 1947, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints organized a hukilau in La'ie to fundraise money to replace their wooden chapel, which had burned down. Because the hukilau was so popular, the visitor industry asked the La'ie community to continue this fishing method as a visitor attraction. So for years, it was held on this beach. Only when in 1970, the state determined that it was a commercial endeavor that needed to be taxed, the community found the hukilau to be unprofitable and discontinued this popular event. But up until today, the beach here is known as Hukilau Beach.     ",,"swimming, surfing, bodyboarding, fishing",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/hukilaubeachpark.php
Ka'a'awa Beach Park,"Ka'a'awa Beach Park (see more photos , view panorama) on Oahu's windward coast has a narrow sandy beach. Because of a shallow reef on the nearshore ocean bottom, the swimming conditions are rather poor. There are a few sandy patches on the nearshore ocean bottom where it's fun to splash around in. Otherwise snorkeling can be fun when the ocean is calm. The beach park is mainly used by fishermen, campers and picnickers. Fishermen come here to catch he'e (octopus).

Ka'alawai Beach,"Ka'alawai Beach is located at the foothills of Diamond Head on Oahu's south shore.The beach fronts the upscale neighborhood of Ka'alawai. It is a narrow, white-sand beach with a shallow reef offshore, which makes for poor swimming conditions. There are only a few scattered pockets of sand on the nearshore ocean bottom. Freshwater bubbles up between the rocks of the reef. That's probably why the beach is called “Ka'alawai,” which means “the watery rock” in the Hawaiian language. The beach is mainly used by surfers, who paddle out to the surf spot called Brown's, which is located just behind the reef.   A famous museum lies at the eastern end of the beach – Shangri La (also known as Doris Duke Foundation). This mansion is the former home of Doris Duke, who was the daughter and only child of James Duke, the founder of the American Tobacco Company. After her father's death, she became one of the wealthiest women in the world. The mansion is now an art museum, featuring Islamic art.

Ka'ena Point State Park,"Ka'ena, which means ""red hot"" or ""glowing"" in the Hawaiian language, is the name of the northwestern tip of the island of Oahu. Ka'ena Point State Park (view panorama) is so remote that no road leads here. Access is only possible by hiking here, either from the road that ends north of Makaha on the west shore, or from the road that ends behind the Dillingham Airfield on the north shore. The 853-acre (3.45 sq. km) park stretches for 9 miles (14.5 km) around the northwestern tip and is home to numerous seabirds, including albatrosses and rare native plants. The whole area is steeped in legend, such as stories of Pohaku o Kauai and Ka Leina a ka Uhane. Pohaku o Kauai, meaning ""rock of Kauai,"" is a rock in the ocean just off Ka'ena Point that was named after the demigod Maui tried to join Oahu and the neighbor island of Kauai. He took his magic hook ""mana i ka lani,"" meaning ""divine power of heaven,"" and threw it across the Ka'ie'ie Waho Channel to snag Kauai. After tugging on the tagline he could only loosen a large boulder. The rock fell into the ocean at Ka'ena Point where it remains up until today as Pohaku o Kauai. According to Hawaiian folklore, Ka'ena Point was also known as the place where souls depart from the earth, as a ""jumping off"" place, a ""leina a ka uhane."" After a person died, the soul would find its way to a leina a ka uhane, such as the one at Ka'ena Point. The exact point was called ""ka leina a ka uhane,"" meaning ""the leap of the soul."" It is also known as White Rock because of a large limestone formation on the north side of the point.   Ka'ena Point has a rocky shore and is backed by sand dunes. The best thing to do here is fishing and hiking. Stay out of the water because dangerous rip currents and very large waves are often times present. There are also a lot of rocks in the water. So swimming, snorkeling or other water activities are not recommended and there are no lifeguards. Ka'ena Point State Park includes the nearby Makua Beach and Yokohama Bay (also known as Keawa'ula Beach). These are the only sand beaches where swimming is possible when the ocean is calm. If you plan to hike to Ka'ena Point from the leeward (west) coast, you can drive all the way to Yokohama Beach, up to where the road ends, park there and walk north. There is a narrow trail that will lead you to Ka'ena Point. Take a water bottle with you because the area is often times hot and dry (there is no shade). It will take you about 1 to 1.5 hours one-way. Keep in mind that the albatrosses there are protected by law, so don't try to go close to them or to find their nest. On the way to Ka'ena Point (on the trail that leads there from Yokohama Beach), you may come across some dumped or abandoned junk cars that have been thrown over the cliffs or parked on the side of the trail. Sometimes just the motor parts or tires are left – a not so pretty sight in paradise and very unfortunate that this happens. Alternatively, you may also hike to Ka'ena Point from the trail that begins at the end of Farrington Highway on the north shore, just past Dillingham Airfield and Camp Erdman Beach.

The sandy beach is a great spot for sunbathing, and the ironwood trees provide plenty of shade for a picnic. On the south end of the bay where Kahana Stream enters the ocean is an ancient Hawaiian fishpond called Huilua.   The waters are generally calm, but few people go swimming here because the water is murky from the runoff of Kahana Stream and the nearshore ocean bottom is rocky.

Kahanamoku Beach,"Waikiki Beach is known around the world and since it is 2 miles (3.2 km) long it has several sections. The western end is known as Kahanamoku Beach. It fronts the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon. The beach is named after Duke Paoa Kahanamoku (1890-1968), who is perhaps the most remembered and respected Hawaiian surfer, a champion Olympic swimmer and a master of canoeing. He epitomized Hawaiian athleticism and helped the surf sport reach unbelievable popularity worldwide. That's why he is also known as ""The Father of Modern Surfing.""   Kahanamoku Beach is the widest stretch of Waikiki Beach. In 2012, the beach was named the #2 beach in America according to the annual list of ""Dr. Beach."" Dr. Stephen Leatherman, an internationally known coastal scientist, has selected the annual Top 10 Beaches since 1991. Fifty criteria are used to evaluate beaches, which include water and sand quality as well as safety and environmental management.

Apart from the vibrant sand, the place also shines with a festive local atmosphere you won't find anywhere else on the island. But few visitors ever come here. Quiet, sunny and spacious, Kahuku offers a welcome respite from the usually packed Oahu beaches.   Most of the people you will find here are local fishermen. A few others come to surf or picnic. So Kahuku Beach is hardly ever crowded, and there are many secluded spots if you're looking for some peace and quiet. If you're into surfing, head over to the Rice Bowl on the south side or the Seventh Hole on the north for some good waves.   Kahuku Beach is a long and wide white-sand beach with a high limestone shelf. The shelf and the rocky ocean bottom are what make swimming tricky, if not impossible, here.

Kaiaka Bay Beach Park,"Located on Oahu's North Shore on the Kaiaka Point peninsula in Haleiwa (see more photos, view panorama), this spacious (53 acre) beach park is a great spot to relax, have a picnic or play ball games.Because it is located on a peninsula and no major street is nearby, it is quiet here.   Kaiaka means ""shadowy sea"" in the Hawaiian language. The ocean in this area looks brown and murky and indeed as if a shadow has fallen on it. The swimming conditions at the west end of the peninsula are poor because of soil runoff from the nearby Paukauila and Kiki'i Streams. Also, there are many sharp rocks at the water's edge on that side, as well as a dark, detrital sand beach. The best area for swimming is at the east end of the peninsula where there is a sandy beach. But it's more like a dip into the water rather than a swim because of the rocks in the water. From the park one can enjoy nice views of the Waianae Mountains and the neighboring Haleiwa beaches and coastline. Located in the park is what looks like a giant stone mushroom. It is a so-called balancing rock, and legend has it that it floated ashore from the distant land of Kahiki. In Hawaiian the name of this large limestone is Pohaku Lana'i. There are many picnic areas in the park, and several designated campsites are at the northern end of the peninsula. A permit is required to camp here. More info how to get a permit is here. However, there is no shade in this area. It's a large open grassy area. Mostly local families camp here. At the time of writing, a large tent stood here that displayed an upside down Hawaiian flag. Upside down flags symbolize a nation in distress. Some islanders (some of whom are Native Hawaiian), disapprove the U.S. annexation of Hawaii. They want Hawaii to be a sovereign nation.

Kaihalulu Beach,"Kaihalulu Beach (see more photos, view panorama) is located east of the Turtle Bay Resort (see more photos, view panorama) on Oahu's North Shore. The beach doesn't see many visitors mainly because it's not a good beach for water activities such as swimming. The nearshore ocean bottom is rocky and a limestone shelf lines much of the bay. Some visitors have scratched their names and other symbols into the limestone shelf, which looks interesting – like modern-day petroglyphs (rock carvings).   Even though the swimming conditions are poor here, Kaihalulu Beach is a nice beach for a long walk in peaceful surroundings.

To access the beach, park at the Turtle Bay Resort public parking lot and walk towards the right (behind Ola's Restaurant). You can either walk in the sand or along a path that leads along the entire length of Kaihalulu Beach. Near the center of the beach is a small protected wading area called Keiki Pool (view photo).

The beach has just the right size surf for an exciting ride, but is calm enough to be suitable for beginners. Kailua is also a world-class kite and windsurfing destination. Kite and windsurfers usually enter the ocean and surf around the center and north end of the Kailua shore. The best area for swimming and for families with children is near the boat ramp and around the area where the Ka'elepulu Stream enters the ocean (near the south end of the beach). Lifeguards are also stationed in this area. If you're into kayaking, a popular destination is nearby Popoi'a Island (also known as Flat Island), located about a quarter of a mile (400 m) offshore. The island has a small sandy beach, but is otherwise barren. In the center of the island used to be an ancient Hawaiian fishing shrine, but it was destroyed by a tsunami in 1946. In the Hawaiian language, ""popoi'a"" means ""rotten fish."" The name probably refers to offerings that were left behind at the shrine. The area is also great for snorkeling, especially in the summer. Here you'll find a good population of green sea turtles and other rare creatures. Flat Island is also a seabird sanctuary. One thing to watch out for is the occasional appearance of Portuguese man-of-war and box jellyfish. They usually invade the beaches 9-12 days after a full moon, but may appear on other days as well. Their sting can cause a painful rash with even the slightest touch. Watch out for warning signs posted on the beach. Kailua Beach has suffered from erosion for many years, but recently the situation has worsened after several days of high surf in mid-January 2013 when even the Kailua boat ramp partially collapsed. High surf took a chunk out of the shoreline at the south end of the beach, leaving exposed roots of trees. Some of the trees that were close to the shoreline were leaning dangerously or fell down, so that city crews were forced to cut them.

Back in March 2012 the city had tried to repair the beach erosion by spreading 1,500 cubic yards of sand from Ka'elepulu Stream along the beach, but that sand is now gone. Here are photos taken in February 2013 (see photos) that show the damage to the beach after the week of high surf in January. The section of beach at the south end of Kailua Bay is very narrow and there are many exposed roots and tree stumps near the water's edge.

Kaimana Beach,"If you're staying in Waikiki, Kaimana Beach (view panorama), named after the nearby hotel, is just a stroll away and a nice beach to go to. Walk toward Diamond Head, along Kapiolani Park on your left, and you'll get to Kaimana Beach. It is located between the War Memorial Natatorium and the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel.   Kaimana Beach is relatively wide, unlike Waikiki Beach, which is narrow in many areas. It is a nice family beach and many locals like to go here because it is protected by a wide reef and because the nearshore ocean bottom is shallow and sandy. The beach is also an access point for surfers, who paddle out to surf at the popular surf spot Old Man's. Kaimana Beach is also the place where an important historic event took place on December 28, 1902. The steamship Silvertown, which came from San Francisco and had laid a submarine cable from California to Hawaii, anchored here after a 12-day crossing of the ocean. The end of the cable was brought ashore through the Kapua Channel at Kaimana Beach, in a canoe steered by David Pi'ikoi Kahanamoku, an uncle of Duke Kahanamoku (who is perhaps the most remembered and respected Hawaiian surfer). This cable was the first telegraphic link between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland. The first message was sent to President Theodore Roosevelt in Washington D.C. on January 1, 1903. Up until today, remnants of the cable, which was abandoned in 1951 for newer communication systems, still lie on the ocean floor in the channel at Kaimana Beach. If you're swimming in this channel, be aware that the current can be quite strong, especially after a high tide when the water is flowing out. Ask the lifeguard on the beach if you're not sure about the tides and wear fins if you plan to swim further out.

Kaiona Beach Park,"Kaiona Beach Park is a small 4-acre park at the base of the Ko'olau Mountains at the south end of Waimanalo Bay on Oahu's windward (east) coast. It's a great beach for kids and novice swimmers because the water is usually calm. The best area for swimming is the area in front of the seawall, to the right (south) of the grassy area. This is where an ancient Hawaiian fishpond called Pahonu Pond is located. During low tide its walls are visible.   Pahonu means “turtle fence” in the Hawaiian language. Legend has it that a former chief of the district liked turtle meat so much that he had the pond built in a way so that it maintained a constant supply of live turtles. The ocean bottom in the fishpond is sandy and is a nice place for swimming. Outside of the pond it is a mixture of rocks and sandy patches. On a sunny day, the water at Kaiona has an amazing turquoise color and is so clear that you get the feeling you're swimming in a pool. It's for a reason that this beach is named Kaiona, which means “attractive sea” in the Hawaiian language. The beach has also been used for many years as a community boat anchorage. In 1999, they community built a boat ramp at the south end of the park for small boats. Two popular landmarks on the beach are the Pahonu and the Shriners Club estates. The latter is a private clubhouse that opened in 1931. It is used for events like weddings, birthday parties and other gatherings.

Kaka'ako Waterfront Park,"The history of Kaka'ako Park (view panorama, see more photos) is an interesting one. While walking over the green, hilly meadows in the park one wouldn't think that this is a former landfill site. In 1948, the City and County of Honolulu constructed a large landfill right here on the shoreline's shallow reef to get rid of material that they couldn't burn.   They built a large seawall that measured 10 feet (3 m) high and 30 feet (9 m) wide at its base that reached all the way from Kewalo Basin at its west end to Pier 1 in Honolulu Harbor at its east end. The landfill was in operation until the 1960s, which added 29 new acres of land to the Kaka'ako shoreline. In 1992, years after the landfill was closed, the Kaka'ako Waterfront Park opened on this former landfill site. The park's shoreline doesn't have a sandy beach. There is a seawall along the water's edge and large boulders. A convenient access point to the ocean is located at the east end of the park, which is used by surfers to enter the water. The park's shaded and spacious grassy areas are the perfect place for family gatherings and picnics. Most people who visit the park come here to do just that – to picnic, relax or do some shoreline fishing. Kaka'ako Waterfront Park is sometimes also referred to as Point Panic Beach Park because of the popular bodysurfing site that's located offshore at the east end of the park, which is called Point Panic. This surf site is strictly for bodysurfers only. No surfboards or bodyboards are allowed. Two other surf sites at the park's west end where board surfing is allowed are called Flies and Incinerators. Kaka'ako is also a popular diving location. Especially on weekends one can see divers in the nearshore waters exploring the coral reef. Two memorials are located within the park, the Ehime Maru Memorial and the Victim Memorial. The Ehime Maru was a Japanese fisheries training vessel that was accidentally rammed by the U.S. Navy Submarine Greenville on February 9, 2001. The Ehime Maru sank and nine crewmembers and students of the Ehime Maru died. The accident occurred about 9 miles (14.5 km) south of Oahu. The Victim Memorial was sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD). It is dedicated to victims and survivors of drunken driving accidents.

In the southern part of the park is a bridge that leads across a small stream. If you go close enough you can spot small fish in it.

Kaloko Beach,"Kaloko Beach on Oahu's southeastern shore is easy to overlook. Most people visit the neighboring Sandy Beach Park and pass by this one. The main reason is because Kaloko Beach isn't a swimming beach. The nearshore ocean bottom is rocky. Also, there is no shade on the beach, so it's not a good picnicking spot either.

Kane'ohe Bay,"It's no stretch to say that Kane'ohe Bay is the stuff of Hollywood. This so-called “living postcard” has provided a scenic backdrop for dozens of popular movies and TV series, the most notable being Pearl Harbor, Gilligan’s Island and 50 First Dates. Hawaiian chiefs reportedly chose this place to build their sacred fishponds, and its historical vibe can be felt up to this day.   Kane'ohe Bay stretches from the Mokapu Peninsula, where the U.S. Marine Corps is based, all the way to Mokoli'i Island, also known as the Chinaman's Hat.This vast stretch of water contains five small islands, including Coconut Island (Moku o Lo'e Island), made popular in the TV series Gilligan's Island. Near the middle of the bay is a sandbar (Ahu o Laka), a popular barbecue spot among local residents who have boats. The bay is also a breeding ground for hammerhead sharks. Thousands of them are born here every year and spend their first few months in the shallow water. Marine scientists flock to the bay to study these oddly-shaped creatures. Eventually, the hammerhead sharks swim out to the deeper waters where they grow up to 13 feet in length. At the north end of Kane'ohe Bay is Kualoa Regional Park, a spacious beach park with nice views of Chinaman's Hat, Apua Fishpond and Kane'ohe Bay.

Kaupo Beach Park,"Kaupo Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is located across the street from Sea Life Park Hawaii on Oahu's southeastern shore. It is a narrow roadside beach park with a sandy beach.Swimming isn't really possible here because the nearshore ocean bottom is rocky, but the snorkeling and diving conditions next to the pier are good. Also, there are a few sand-bottomed pools, where families take their kids to play in.   In the Hawaiian language, Kaupo means “night landing.” It got this name from the former fishing village that used to be located here. Kaupo Beach is also known as Baby Makapu'u, Kumu Cove and Cockroach Bay. The youngest lava flow on Oahu is believed to have occurred here. From the beach one can see the Makai Research Pier. The pier also has a small boat harbor and submarine slip and is used by a few ocean engineering firms. Located offshore are two small islands, Rabbit Island (the larger one, which is also known as Manana Island) and Kaohika'ipu (also known as Black Rock). Both are seabird sanctuaries and landing on them is only allowed with a permit. Another feature at Kaupo Beach can easily be overlooked because it is just a rock that's mostly submerged at high tide. This rock is called Pohaku Pa'akiki, and according to an ancient legend, it is a monument that reminds of the agreement between Hawaiians who lived in this area in the old Hawaii and a guardian shark that there would be no shark attacks here.

Kawela Bay,"Kawela Bay (view panorama) is one of the most secluded beaches on Oahu. Located near the Turtle Bay Resort on the island's North Shore, it is a perfect spot to unwind. Bathe in the calm water or enjoy a peaceful stroll along the beach. The sandy beach is narrow and backed by coconut palms and ironwood trees. Watch out for falling coconuts! This curved bay is one the most protected on Oahu's North Shore because of the reef that diffuses high waves during the winter months when other North Shore beaches get pounded by high surf. Kawela Bay's nearshore waters are calm year-round.   Swimming at Kawela Bay is ok, but not the best because the water is often times murky and some areas of the bay have rocks on the ocean bottom. So it is tricky to avoid the rocky patches and to watch out for your toes. For the same reason, the snorkeling isn't that good because you can't see much. A couple of surf sites are located on the outer reefs of the bay, but here the currents can be strong. Located in the small forest behind Kawela Bay is a beautiful large banyan tree (view photos). It is marked by a plaque that says: ""This single tree, an amazing expanse of multiple trunks and vines, is routinely used as a filming location for major motion pictures and television shows, including LOST and Pirates of the Caribbean. Older banyan trees have ""prop roots"" that eventually grow into trunks as large as the original, and many banyans live to be several hundred years old.""

In the past, houses stood along Kawela Bay's entire length. But in 1986, all residents from the bay's east point to the center were evicted to make way for a resort that was never built. So up until today, the property along this part of the bay remains undeveloped. There are only a few beach homes along the bay's west end. There have been talks in the recent past that more vacation rentals were being planned at the east end of Kawela Bay. However, in May 2014, Turtle Bay Resort along with the State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu and The North Shore Community Land Trust, established a conservation easement on 665.8 acres of land. This agreement protects Kawela Bay from future development. Even though no development will take place for now, Kawela Bay has seen some major changes in 2014. Kawela Bay's backshore used to be heavily forested (view photos), but many trees and shrubs have recently been removed. There are a few signs that explain the deforestation. The signs say: ""Turtle Bay Resort is working with the State of Hawaii and shoreline experts to prune overgrown non-native vegetation to clear the shoreline and improve beach access (view photo)."" Because Kawela Bay is much easier accessible now, the bay is seeing more commercial activities take place. Surf schools are driving right up to the beach to take students for surf lessons in the bay. To reach the bay, walk along the shore from the Turtle Bay Resort. It takes about 20-30 minutes to get there. Alternatively, Kawela Bay is also accessible via a footpath from Kamehameha Highway.       ",,"swimming, surfing, fishing",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/kawela-bay.php
Ke'ehi Lagoon Beach Park,"This urban beach park is located next to the Honolulu International Airport. Ke'ehi Lagoon (see more photos) is a great place for canoeing and boating since the waters are usually calm in the protected lagoon.Many canoe clubs do their practice session here and outrigger canoe regattas take place from time to time. However, the man-made beach is not suitable for swimming, snorkeling or surfing. There is a large grassy area with soccer, baseball, softball and cricket fields, tennis courts, a pavilion and restrooms. In the weekends, the park is often times used for family gatherings since it's a good place to barbecue. When outrigger canoe races take place here, many paddlers as well as spectators come to the park. Even though the beach park is located on a major highway, the views over to neighboring Sand Island and the city are nice. And since the park is located right next to the airport, one can see many planes take off and land from up close.

Located within Ke'ehi Lagoon are several tiny islands. One of them is Mokauea Island. Encompassing a mere 10 acres, this tiny spit of land is the site of Oahu's last Hawaiian fishing village (and one of two left in the entire state of Hawaii).

Kokololio Beach Park,"Kokololio, meaning “gusty” in Hawaiian, is the name of a valley and a stream, located north of the town Hau'ula on Oahu's northeastern shore. The beach park (view panorama) lies at the foot of the valley and next to the stream. Kokololio Beach is a nice stretch of sand and during the summer months, swimming is possible here. During weekends, especially in the summer months, local residents like to camp at Kokololio.The beach park is a county camp site, but permits are required. More info about how to get a permit is here. In the winter time, it's a nice spot to take some great pictures of the pounding shorebreak or to go surfing or bodyboarding. Offshore is a popular surf spot named CYO's, which stands for Catholic Youth Organization. The CYO used the house that stood once there (from the Cooke family) as a retreat before it was bought by the City and taken down to develop the park in 1991. The limestone sea cliff that reaches into the ocean on the northern end of the beach is called Pali Kiloi'a, meaning “fish-spotter cliff” in the Hawaiian language. The ancient Hawaiians used this cliff to locate fish in the bay. From up here they gave directions to net fishermen in their canoes. The area is still a popular site for fishermen today, who fish for o'io, moi, papio and ulua (giant trevally). Editor's note: There are a few homes at the north end of the beach. When we walked along the beach there, suddenly two large dogs came running towards us from one of the beach houses. Their owner wasn't in sight. The dogs were very territorial and only left us alone after we yelled at them. We felt threatened and left immediately. If you're visiting Kokololio Beach, you may want to avoid the beach area near the homes because the home owners don't seem to attend their dogs and there is no fence, so the dogs have access to the public beach.

Ko Olina Lagoons,"Four sandy beaches make up the picturesque Ko Olina Lagoons (see more photos), one of the few man-made water bodies in the Hawaiian Islands, located on Oahu's southwestern shore. From the manicured lawns to the fancy nearby resorts, the modern vibe can be felt the minute you arrive.   The four lagoons – Hanu, Naia, Kolola and Ulua – are shielded from high surf by large rock barriers. This makes the water safe to swim in year-round, although some find it too calm for most water sports, such as surfing or bodyboarding. A paved walkway connects the four lagoons, so the entire area is also a nice place for a shoreline stroll. One area to stay away from are the lagoons' rock barriers. These rocks can be dangerous to climb because they are slippery. Also, the currents can be strong between the barriers, and you could be dragged out into the open ocean if you swim in this area, especially when the surf is up.

Kualoa Regional Park,"Oahu may be Hawaii's party island, but it also got its share of calm, peaceful beaches. If you're looking to just sit back and relax, a trip to Kualoa Regional Park (see more photos, view panorama) may be just the break you need. It is located just off of Kamehameha Highway, but since the park has a large grassy area, one can't hear the noise from the highway at the beach.   Kualoa means “long ancestral background” in the Hawaiian language, a fitting tribute to the area's interesting history. In the old Hawaii, chiefs brought their children here to learn learn about their heritage and traditions. The park itself was once a sacred town. Today, the park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of Kualoa Park's main attractions is the view to nearby Mokoli'i Island. According to an ancient legend, the island is a fluke from the tail of a large dragon. Hi'iaka, sister of the goddess Pele, slew the creature and threw its tail into the bay. Mokoli'i, which means “little lizard,” is said to be part of the tail. From the shore, the island looks a bit like a coolie's hat, which has earned it the nickname “Chinaman's Hat.” The island (located about 600 yards offshore) is a kayaking destination (others paddle here with a surfboard). Some people even try to swim to the island during low tide because this is when the water is very shallow. However, swimming here is not a good idea because the current can be unpredictable and high tide can come in sooner than you think. People have drowned here in the past while trying to swim back to shore from the island. The beach at Kualoa Park is narrow and the nearshore ocean bottom is shallow with some rocky patches. So the swimming isn't that great here. At the south end of the park is a stone barrier, so this is a nice area for a dip. This is also where two ancient Hawaiian fishponds are located - Moli'i and Apua Fishpond. Kualoa Park is open to campers and has around 30 small campsites.

Kuhio Beach,"Kuhio Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is part of Waikiki Beach, located between the Sheraton Moana Surfrider Hotel and the Kapahulu Groin (The Wall), which was built in 1951 as part of the Waikiki Beach Improvement Project. It is an extension of a storm drain that runs under Kapahulu Avenue. The project also included building a low wall on the Diamond Head side of the groin and importing sand to create the beaches on both sides. Today, this area right in front of the groin is a popular surf spot among bodyboarders. Surfboards are not allowed here. To the west of the beach park are two of Waikiki's popular surf sites, Queen's and Canoes. Three popular landmarks are located in Kuhio Beach Park: the Prince Kuhio Statue, the Duke Kahanamoku Statue and the Stones of Kapaemahu.The Prince Kuhio Statue was created by sculptor Sean Browne and was dedicated in 2002. The Duke Kahanamoku Statue was created by sculptor Jan-Michelle Sawyer and dedicated on 1990, the hundredth anniversary of Duke's birth. He is considered the “Father of Modern Surfing,” a great Hawaiian watermen, Olympic swimmer, surfer and canoeist. The Stones of Kapaemahu, also known as the Wizard Stones, represent four legendary men: Kapaemahu, Kahaloa, Kapuni and Kinohi, who came to Hawaii from a faraway land. In Hawaii they were famous for their great wisdom and healing powers. If you were in Waikiki between January and April of 2012, you may have wondered why there was this large barge offshore and construction going on right on popular Kuhio Beach. It's because the beach is literally disappearing due to the erosive force of the ocean. So the City decided that it was again time for a sand replenishment project. A barge collected about 24,000 cubic yards of sand offshore and pumped it through a pipe to the beach. Some local residents were concerned that the sand was taken from the same area where ashes of the deceased have been scattered for generations, including the ashes of Don Ho and Duke Kahanamoku. Prior to the start of the 4-month project the state held a blessing ceremony, and officials from the State Department of Land and Natural Resources told the people that work crews are sensitive to their concerns. The beach is all fixed up now and is wider than it was before. You can see some construction photos here. Kuhio Beach Park was named after Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, born in 1871. His home, Pualeilani (meaning “flower from the wreath of heaven”) used to stand here, and he lived here with his wife Princess Elizabeth Kahanu.

Kuilei Cliffs Beach Park,"Kuilei Cliffs Beach Park (view panorama) lies at the foothills of Diamond Head, between the Diamond Head Lighthouse and the residential community of Kaalawai.The 11-acre beach park has a narrow beach backed by sea cliffs. The beach sand has a greenish hue and glitters in the sun. The sand along this stretch of coastline has already made an impression to early sailors. In 1825, British sailors noticed small sparkling calcite crystals in the beach sand along the crater's foothills and sea cliffs. They named the crater Diamond Hill. This name was later changed to Diamond Head. This is how the crater got its English name.   There are three popular drive-in lookouts along Diamond Head Road that offer sweeping views of this stretch of coastline. To get to the beach, walk down the paved trail, located between two of the lookouts. The swimming conditions aren't good here because the nearshore ocean bottom is shallow and has a reef. However, this beach is a surfers' paradise as the reef generates waves almost every day and it is a lot less crowded here than in Waikiki. When the tradewinds are strong, this area is also popular among windsurfers. The middle lookout is the site of a memorial to Amelia Earhart (1898-1939), who was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1935, she was the first person to fly alone from Hawaii to North America. In 1939, she tried to fly from New Guinea to Howland Island, on her way to Hawaii, but she never reached Howland Island and was never seen again. The monument on this lookout was created by Kate Kelly, Honolulu's leading sculptress of the 1930s.

The beach fronting the beach park is known as Pounders Beach because of its often times pounding shorebreak. A shallow sandbar is responsible for the pounding surf and strong currents. Be cautious because this sandbar drops off abruptly.   The limestone cliff at the south end of the beach is called Pali Kiloi'a, which means ""fish-spotter cliff"" in the Hawaiian language. It is a popular spot for shoreline fishermen who fish for o'io, moi, papio and ulua (giant trevally). A calmer area for swimming is at the north end of the beach near the old pier pilings. And if you walk along the shore around the corner, there is another small beach which locals call “bathtub beach.” An offshore coral reef buffers incoming waves, making the water less turbulent here (except during high surf season when you may not even be able to walk to this area along the shore). If you prefer to stay dry, the beach is lined with large ironwood trees which provide plenty of shade for a picnic. There are no facilities on the beach, but some shops and a grocery store is located in La'ie. The beach park is close to Brigham Young University and the Polynesian Cultural Center.

La'ie Point State Wayside Park,"La'ie Point State Wayside Park (see more photos, view panorama) lies on a peninsula in the town La'ie on Oahu's northeastern shore. This place is steeped in Hawaiian legend, one of which according to William Rice in his Hawaiian Legends goes like this:   ""Laniloa is the name given to a point of land which extends into the ocean from La'ie. In ancient times this point was mo‘o, standing upright, ready to kill the passerby. After Kana and his brother had rescued their mother from Molokai and had taken her back to Hawaii, Kana set out on a journey around the islands to kill all the mo‘o. In due time he reached La'ie, where the mo‘o was killing many people. Kana had no difficulty in destroying this monster. Taking its head, he cut it into five pieces and threw them into the sea, where they can be seen today as the five small islands lying off Malaekahana."" This legend of the Laniloa mo‘o can be read on a granite plaque attached to a boulder in the park. The five small islands along this shoreline are called Kihewamoku, Moku'auia, Pulemoku, Kukuiho'olua and Mokualai. Tour buses with visitors often times stop here to enjoy the scenic view. The peninsula is also frequented by fishermen, who primarily fish for ulua (trevally).     ",,fishing,Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/laiepointpark.php
Laniakea Beach,"Laniakea Beach (view panorama) on Oahu's North Shore is also known as Turtle Beach. The main attraction here is the green sea turtles who often times can be seen on the beach basking in the sun. On other Oahu beaches, you're lucky if you can spot one of these amazing animals in the ocean, sticking her head out of the water.   But on Laniakea Beach, the turtles come out of the water and don't seem to mind the people who are snapping pictures of them. In recent years the beach has become more crowded. Many circle island tour buses stop here on their way to other attractions. So it can get busy here. The parking area is across the beach on the other side of the highway and there is no traffic light, so this often times causes a traffic jam because many people are crossing the highway here. The Hawaiian honu (green sea turtle) enjoys full protection under the federal Endangered Species Act and under Hawaii state law. It is illegal to chase, hunt, handle, injure or harass them in any way. To make sure that the turtles are not bothered, there are volunteers on Laniakea Beach who inform visitors about the turtles and use a red rope to mark the “no-go” zones. Also, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has put up informational signs. The beach itself is rather small and has a rocky shelf. The turtles enjoy eating the seaweed that grows on it and on the surrounding rocks. When the surf is up, a strong rip current forms in the wide channel on the west side of the beach. Surfers use this beach to get to the offshore surf spots named Laniakea, Himalayas and Hultin's. Unfortunately, Laniakea Beach made tragic headlines in July 2008 when a large turtle named “Honey Girl” was found slaughtered on the beach one morning. She had last been seen resting on the beach under a full moon the evening before. Honey Girl was one of Laniakea's 24 resident turtles and the largest adult female turtle, weighing about 250 pounds. She was about 35-40 years old.     ",,"swimming, snorkeling, surfing",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/laniakeabeach.php
Lanikai Beach,"With a name meaning “heavenly sea,” Lanikai Beach (view panorama) has gained international fame as America's number one beach for several years running. The dreamlike shores of Lanikai have been immortalized on many pictures, postcards, wall calendars and travel guides.   Lanikai Beach is only about half a mile (800 m) long, but it's one of the most scenic stretches of coastline on Oahu.The only way to reach the beach is through small public access paths in this upscale neighborhood of Lanikai. During weekdays and off-season, Lanikai Beach is almost empty, making it the perfect spot if you're looking for some peace and quiet. The beach can get quite crowded during weekends. There are some beautiful reef patches on Lanikai Beach. These underwater gardens are popular among snorkelers and divers. Kayaking is also a popular watersport here. Some people kayak all the way out to the two Mokulua Islands (Moku Nui and Moku Iki). This can be quite challenging, especially if you've never done ocean kayaking before. The waves may look small and calm from shore, but by the time you're half way there they can turn out to be much larger. Lanikai Beach has no showers, restrooms or other facilities. Plan your trip ahead of time so you can stock up on food and supplies. Also, finding a parking spot can be challenging on weekends and holidays. There is no public parking lot that's designated for the beach. Parking is only possible on the side of the street. Between 9-12 days after a full moon (but on other days as well), jellyfish often times get washed ashore. Get out of the water as soon as you spot these translucent creatures, as their sting can leave you off the beach for a good part of the day. Also watch out for limu (stinging seaweed), which can appear after a storm.     ",,"swimming, snorkeling, kayaking",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/lanikaibeach.php

Leftovers Beach Park,"Located on Oahu's North Shore, Leftovers Beach Park (view panorama) is one of the island's lesser-known surf sites.The small beach park can easily be missed as there is only a small pullout parking area along Kamehameha Highway. From here, a hidden trail leads down to the small beach, which is framed by rocks. In the 1960s when big wave surfing first became popular, surfers considered this beach a second choice, or ""leftover"" surf site, paling in comparison to its neighboring beaches of Hale'iwa and Waimea Bay. Coincidentally, this beach also has a ""left"" surf break, meaning a wave that surfers ride to their left.

Lualualei Beach Park,"This is a narrow 18-acre park located along Farrington Highway in Waianae. The beach is sandy, but there is a rocky limestone shelf along the shoreline, which makes entering the ocean difficult. For this reason the beach is empty most of the time as most people prefer swimming at neighboring Pokai Bay or at other beaches in this area. The beach park is mainly used by local fishermen. A surf site called Sewers is located offshore. It is named after the Waianae sewage treatment plant, which is located across from the beach park.

Magic Island Beach,"Magic Island Beach (view panorama) is part of Ala Moana Beach Park, a popular Honolulu city beach, located between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. Many local residents and visitors alike come to Ala Moana Beach Park and adjacent Magic Island to swim, bodyboard, surf, picnic or exercise (jogging, walking, etc.).   Even though it's called Magic Island, this is actually a man-made peninsula. The small curved beach is located at the end of the peninsula. Most people prefer to swim at Ala Moana Beach instead of at Magic Island Beach. The reason is that the ocean bottom at Magic Island Beach is a bit rocky in some areas and the sand is not as smooth. Also, the swimming area here is a lot smaller. Magic Island Beach has a rock barrier, so it is protected from incoming waves. However, when the surf is up, the waves can still wash over the rocks, so then it's best stay away from the barrier. Also, it's not a good idea to swim in or through the openings of the rock barrier because the current can be strong in this area. Magic Island Beach is backed by a large grassy area with trees and picnic tables. The Magic Island peninsula (made of dredged coral) was built onto the reef off Ala Moana Beach Park in the 1960s (completed in 1964). It was supposed to be the location of a new resort hotel, but the hotel was never built. So the peninsula was instead turned into a public park. The peninsula was later renamed to 'Aina Moana (meaning “land from the sea”), but people seem to prefer the name Magic Island and still call it that way today.

Ma'ili Beach Park,"This is a long white-sand beach located along Farrington Highway on Oahu's west shore (see more photos, view panorama) .The 40-acre park is named after the small town of Ma'ili. Much of the shoreline is lined by rock shelves. In the winter months, the beach gets pounded by high surf and strong currents can be present on any day. There is a spacious park with plenty of room for a picnic. A popular surf site called Green Lanterns is just offshore near the mouth of Ma'ili'ili Stream, and another one called Tumbleland is near the center of the beach. Camping is allowed at Ma'ili Beach Park, but a permit is required. For more info on how to get a permit, see here.   Inland from Ma'ili Beach Park is the Naval Radio Transmitter Facility Lualualei (NRTF Lualualei). The two tallest masts are 1,503 feet (458 m) tall. When they were built in 1972, they were the tallest man-made structure in the Western Hemisphere at the time. The facility is used to transmit high and low frequency radio signals to communicate with Navy vessels including submarines throughout the Pacific.

Makaha Beach Park,"Makaha Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is located on Oahu's leeward (west) coast and offers good swimming, bodyboarding and surfing conditions. The swimming is better in the summer months when the ocean is generally calmer here (but exceptions are always possible). In the winter months, the surf is often times up and there is a strong shorebreak and rip currents. This is when Makaha Beach is only suitable for experienced surfers. Before going into the water, pay attention to all signs posted at the beach and ask the lifeguards about the current ocean conditions.   If you want to swim, enter the ocean in the middle section of the beach where there is no reef. Surfers usually prefer the northern end of the beach because this is where the waves break on the reef (near the hotel). However, it's only recommended for experienced surfers. Especially during low tide the reef is close to the water's surface and it is sharp. Makaha Beach Park is located on the driest side of the island, so especially in the summer months it is hot and dry here. Bring enough water and sunscreen and maybe even a beach umbrella because there is not much shade on the beach. Makaha Beach Park is one of the more popular beach parks on this side of the island, but nevertheless the beach is hardly ever crowded. The busiest times are the weekends when local residents come here with their families to picnic and relax. There are a few picnic tables, restrooms and showers.

Makaleha Beach Park,"Makaleha Beach Park (view panorama) is one of the lesser-known beaches on Oahu's North Shore, located about 13 miles (21 km) west from popular Sunset Beach and Waimea Bay.It is beautiful with a long and curved sandy beach, azure blue waters and trees that provide ample shade.   The beach park is easy to miss from Farrington Highway, so many people drive right by it. It is accessible via a narrow beach access trail (look for a blue sign that says “public right-of-way to beach"" which is hidden behind bushes and sometimes parked cars), located right across from the driveway to the Dillingham Lodge. There is no designated beach parking lot, only roadside parking. After a 5-minute walk on the beach access trail you'll reach Makaleha Beach. It is backed by fenced-off private property where horses are being kept. The nearshore waters right where the beach access trail ends are rocky. But if you walk a little bit to the west (left), there is a sandy channel in the reef. When the ocean is calm, the snorkeling can be good here. In the winter months (November to March), Oahu's North Shore often gets pounded by high surf. There are no lifeguards stationed here. The beach park also has no facilities.

Makalei Beach Park,"Located at the base of Diamond Head at the eastern end of Waikiki, Makelei Beach Park (view panorama) has a small and narrow beach.The swimming conditions are limited here because there is a reef on the nearshore ocean bottom.   It's a nice place to dip in the water and on most days (especially on weekdays) the beach is empty. It can't be seen from the road. To get to it you'll have to walk through the beachfront park all the way to the stone seawall that lines the park's oceanfront and then turn right. The beach is backed by a few luxury beachfront homes. The beach park itself has some large trees that provide plenty of shade, and there are picnic tables and benches. The park is also used by surfers to access a few surf sites located offshore, some of which have scary or strange sounding names, such as Graveyards, Suicides, Radicals, Sleepy Hollows and Ricebowls.

Makapu'u Beach Park,"Backed by sea cliffs, Makapu'u Beach Park (view panorama) is popular among bodyboarders and bodysurfers. Rip currents and a powerful shorebreak make for a very rough ride, perfect for adventure seekers. During the summer months the ocean is usually calmer than in the winter months (November to February), but even in the summer there are waves here almost every day. In other words, Makapu'u is not suitable for a leisurely swim. The width of the beach varies throughout the year. In the winter, high surf erodes the beach and exposes large boulders in the shorebreak.   Just around the corner from Makapu'u Beach on the sea cliff is Makapu'u Lighthouse. A paved trail leads to it that can be accessed from a parking lot along Kalanianaole Highway. This area is known as the Ka Iwi State Scenic Shoreline. Also located just south of Makapu'u Beach is the Makapu'u Lookout (also has a parking lot). From up here you can enjoy a nice view of Makapu'u Beach and two islands - Rabbit Island (the larger one, also known as Manana Island) and Black Rock (the smaller one, also known as Kaohikaipu Island).

Makua Beach,"Makua Beach is one of the most secluded and far away beaches on Oahu. This undeveloped and never crowded white-sand beach is backed by the Waianae Mountain Range and Makua Valley (after which the beach is named). Most Oahu visitors never get to see this beach. That's because no tour buses go here, and most people who make the effort to drive to the remote leeward coast of Oahu only drive up to Makaha Beach, a popular big wave surfing beach in the winter months. After the small town of Makaha the development soon ends and there aren't any other buildings. Even the road narrows.   From November to April, there is some excellent surf on this side of the island, perfect for expert surfers. Unlike many Oahu beaches, Makua Beach is not protected by an offshore reef, so the waves can get really high and the currents strong on rough days. The ocean bottom drops off quickly here, so swimmers should stay close to the shore. Fishing and bodyboarding are popular activities on calmer days. There are no lifeguards or facilities here. Makua Beach is the second last beach where the road ends (the last one is Yokohama Bay). Both beaches are part of the Ka'ena Point State Park. If you're up for a hike, there is a trail that leads to the northwestern tip of the island. Ka'ena Point is supposedly a ""leina a ka uhane,"" or a jumpoff point for departing souls.

Located just offshore on the south end of the bay is the small Moku'auia Island, also known as Goat Island. If you are eager to explore it and want to be on a secluded island all by yourself, you can swim over, take a body- or surfboard with you or when it's low tide, simply walk over because the water is shallow enough. Just put some reef shoes on to prevent cuts on your feet. Goat Island is a real hidden paradise. It has a white, sandy beach and green sea turtles can be spotted in the area.

In the Hawaiian language, Mauna Lahilahi means “thin mountain.” It rises 230 feet (70 m) and provides a scenic backdrop. The beach itself is narrow and fronted by a reef. The swimming conditions are therefore rather poor.   The beach park is located right on Farrington Highway, so one can hear the traffic at all times. There are a few picnic tables in the park, but since they are not standing in the shade of a tree, they are almost always empty. There are a few scattered trees near the southern end of the beach that are a better spot for a picnic (if you don't have a beach umbrella). However, some of the trees have sharp thorns, so avoid picnicking under one of those. On the far southern side of the beach are three small coves.

Maunalua Bay Beach Park,"Maunalua Bay (view panorama, see more photos), located in Hawaii Kai on Oahu's south shore, is a favorite spot among canoe paddlers, boaters, kayakers, fishers and picnickers. Swimming conditions are rather poor here because the ocean bottom is shallow and rocky, but the views are nice and other ocean activities possible. Maunalua means “two mountains” and refers to Koko Crater and Koko Head, the two peaks located east of Maunalua Bay.   The beach park, which borders Kalanianaole Highway, was developed by Henry J. Kaiser when the Hawaii Kai Marina was built. In the past, the beach consisted of 535,000 square feet (49,703 sq. m) of coral that was dredged from the bay and pumped into low places along the existing shore. A boat channel was also dredged and upon completion of the park, Kaiser donated it to the City and County of Honolulu in 1960. The Hawaii Kai Marina was once a huge fishpond named Kuapa. At one point it covered 523 acres (2.1 sq. km) and its wall was 5,000 feet (1.5 km) long. There is a canoe storage building, or halau, at the west end of the park.

From the beach one has access to several popular surf spots, including Park Rights and Day Star, a little further to the west. When the winds are blowing from the south (Kona winds), it means good conditions for kite- and windsurfers. And when the water is calm and the surf low, the shallow reef provides good conditions for snorkeling and spearfishing. Watch out for strong swells that are common in the winter months.

It's a better spot to kayak or fish. Also, surfers paddle out here to reach the waves of Paikos and other surf spots that are located at the outer edge of the reef.   Paiko Beach is named after Joseph Paiko who died on June 1, 1942. His father Manuel Paiko came to Hawaii as a whaler in the 1840s. He came from Pico, one of the nine main islands of the Azores, located about 800 miles (1,287 km) off the coast of Portugal. He was known as “Manuel do Pico” and his name later became “hawaiianized” into Paiko. Paiko senior was one of the first Portuguese to settle in Hawaii, who came to Hawaii even before the first group of Portuguese contract laborers came in 1878. The undeveloped Paiko Peninsula is located at the east end of the beach. Local residents call it Sand Point. The peninsula encloses the saltwater Paiko Lagoon, which was designated as a wildlife sanctuary by the State Department of Land and Natural Resources in 1974.

Papa'iloa Beach,"Papa'iloa Beach (view panorama) is among the lesser-known beaches on Oahu's North Shore.It only became more popular in recent years because of the TV series LOST, which was partially filmed near here.

Papa'iloa is a beautiful and long white-sand beach fronting the beachfront community of the same name. A shallow reef lines much of the coastline, so it is not a prime beach to go swimming.   Several surf spots are located offshore. One of the more popular spots is called Himalayas. The surf spot was named by two big-wave surfers in the late 1950s who after surfing here believed that they had ridden the highest surf in the world and named this place after the highest mountains in the world – the Himalayas.

During the winter months, the waves can get very big and the ocean currents erode the parts of the beach that are not protected by a reef.

Poka'i Bay Beach Park,"Because of its breakwater offshore that blocks high surf, Poka'i Bay (see more photos, view panorama) is the most protected beach on the leeward (west) coast of Oahu. It is calm year-round, while other beaches on the leeward coast get strong surf in the winter months. So this is a good place to take the kids or to swim if you're a novice swimmer. The calmest area is at the southern end of the bay, next to the breakwater. There's a wide reef in the middle of the bay and the waves that break on it are usually small, which makes it a good spot for beginning surfers. Poka'i Bay lies between the small boat harbor in Wai'anae and Kane'ilio Point, a peninsula which is home to the Ku'ilioloa Heiau, an ancient Hawaiian temple site.The peninsula's shoreline has a few memorials for people whose ashes have been scattered offshore. It is also a popular fishing location. In the center of the bay is the Wai'anae Army Recreation Center, which was acquired by the federal government in 1918. The bay is named after the Hawaiian chief Pokai, who is said to have brought the first coconut palm tree to Hawaii. “Ka Uluniu o Pokai” is the famous coconut grove that once lined the backshore. There is a sign with a plaque at the beginning of the peninsula that tells of the history of this area. It says: Malaea Pokai Bay was originally named Malaea, meaning ""calm"" or ""serene."" Malaea shelters the sandy beach of Nene'u and the site of the temple called Ku'ilioloa Heiau at Kane'ilio Point. Dedicated to a dog kupua (spirit), rites performed at the heiau protected those traveling by land and sea. At the north end of the bay is Kaupuni Stream, the spawning ground of anae (mullet) which gave Wai'anae (mullet waters) its name.

To get to Police Beach, one either has to walk along the shoreline from Papa'iloa Beach or Pua'ena Point Beach Park because the backshore of Police Beach is private property. Episodes of the popular TV series LOST were filmed on Police Beach. The beach is sandy, but many areas on the water's edge are covered by a lava rock shelf. The ocean bottom offshore is rocky too, so swimming isn't possible here (also because of strong rip currents, especially when the surf is up). Several surf spots are located offshore. Also, local fishermen come here for shoreline fishing.

In the winter when the surf is up and dangerous, swimming, snorkeling and diving are often times not possible or recommended.   Shark's Cove got its name from a popular story that says that the outline of a reef outside the cove looks like a shark when seen from above. In the summer months, Shark's Cove is a prime snorkeling spot, and even though the access to the water makes you wish you were a mountain goat, it is a very popular destination (finding a parking spot can be challenging on busy summer weekends). To get to the ocean, you have to climb down a steep dirt path. There is no sandy beach here, just a few sandy patches between the boulders that line the shore.  Three Tables is named like that because of the three flat reefs that lie off the beach. The “tables” emerge above the ocean's surface during low tide. It's another great snorkeling spot, also only in summer as the surf is too wild and too dangerous in winter. In between both beaches you find a beachcomber's paradise with tide pools, surreal lava formations and the occasional blowhole. In the middle section of the park is the Honolulu Fire Department's Sunset Beach Fire Station, an important base for the North Shore of Oahu. The firefighters stationed here also respond to many ocean rescues. Pupukea Beach Park (see more photos) is a marine life conservation area and has several great spots to play in the water along its narrow 80 acres on the side of Kamehameha Highway. Across the street is a Foodland supermarket (only grocery store in this area), and you'll find many small surf-wear stores and roadside food trucks nearby.

Queen's Surf Beach,"Named after Queen Liliuokalani because her beach house and its pier used to stand here, Queen's Surf Beach (see more photos, view panorama) is located right in Waikiki and is actually a section of Waikiki Beach.It is located between the Kapahulu Groin on its west end and the Waikiki Aquarium on its east end.   The Kapahulu Groin was built in 1951 and surfers named it The Wall, or in short Walls. Walls is also the name of the nearby surf break, which is reserved exclusively for bodyboarders (no surfboards are allowed within 150 yards of it and the area is marked by buoys). Another popular big-wave surf spot, named Cunha's, is located straight out from The Wall. So besides being a bodyboarder's paradise, Queen's Surf Beach is also a great spot for snorkelers. There is a reef in front of the Waikiki Aquarium where snorkeling is good when the water is calm. In the park near The Wall is a bronze sculpture, which was dedicated by the City and County of Honolulu in 2003. Designed by artist Robert Pashby, It's called “Surfer on a Wave” and it is a monument to surfing in Waikiki. The Kapahulu Groin also marks the western boundary of the Waikiki Marine Life Conservation District, which goes all the way from the Groin east to the War Memorial Natatorium. In this area, fishing and removing marine life is prohibited. If you like movies, come here on weekend evenings when free outdoor movies are shown on a big movie screen (you can't miss it, just look out for the large construction right on the beach). The event, known as Sunset on the Beach, includes music entertainment prior to the movie and food booths and begins at around 4 p.m. The movie begins around sunset, or around 7 p.m.    ",,"bodyboarding, snorkeling, swimming",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/queensbeach.php
Sand Island Beach Park,"Sand Island Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) may not be the typical picture-perfect tropical beach, but it has other charms that make it a good place to visit.The small island is located right offshore from Honolulu Harbor on Oahu. It is accessible via the Sand Island Access Road.   From here you can enjoy unique views of Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head and the Honolulu International Airport. Besides the many low-flying airplanes of which you'll get up-close views, you'll also see many incoming freight and passenger ships and often times even big cruise ships that anchor right there in the harbor. Sand Island used to be an important location for coastal defense in World War II. The deserted lookout towers and bunkers that are still here today are remnants of this time. They make for an almost surreal contrast to the grassy areas, swinging palm trees and the blue waters of the Pacific. The long, sandy beach is never crowded and the beach park is a good place for picnics. Camping is also possible here Fridays through Mondays, but only with a permit. More info on how to get a permit is here. The swimming conditions are fair, due to rocks in the water and the fact that Sand Island is near a busy harbor and underground sewer canals. Swimming is also limited to certain areas and not allowed in the harbor shipping lanes. However, fishing is good and you'll see many local fishermen trying their luck. Surfing is also possible; the waves are best in the summer months. No lifeguards are stationed on Sand Island. As for amenities, picnic tables and restrooms are available. Keep in mind that it's not safe to go on top of the lookout towers or bunkers. They are closed to the public. Never swim in the harbor lanes and follow all warning signs.

Sandy Beach Park,"Sandy Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is located on Oahu's southeastern shore. With its pounding waves and powerful shorebreak, it is popular among experienced bodyboarders and bodysurfers. This beach is known as one of the most dangerous beaches in Hawaii, and people call it ""the beach of broken necks"" or ""Broke Neck Beach"" for a reason. It is sad that numerous people have become paralized after enjoying the waves at Sandy's. Others have drowned.   On most days of the year, you will see red warning flags and signs posted on the beach that warn people about the dangers (which are: strong currents, dangerous shorebreak, high surf and sharp coral). Even if the ocean looks calm, which is rare here as there are waves on almost every day of the year, be aware that there could be dangerous currents. Many people come to Sandy Beach Park to just watch the waves, take photos and relax on the beach. There is no shade on the beach though. The beach park has a large grassy area with picnic tables, restrooms and showers.      ",,"surfing, bodyboarding, fishing",Oahu,https://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/beaches/sandy-beach-park.php
Shark's Cove,"Don't worry, you will most likely not run into any sharks when swimming at Shark's Cove (view panorama). This cove got its name from a popular story that says that the outline of a reef outside the cove looks like a shark when seen from above.   Shark's Cove is a lava-rock beach on the North Shore of Oahu and is part of Pupukea Beach Park. It is unique not only because of its spectacular underwater rock formations, but also because of its diverse marine life. Tropical colorful fish and sea turtles are the cove's constant inhabitants. Harmless white-tipped reef sharks may also be spotted just outside the cove. Because of its amazing underwater world, Shark's Cove is a favorite spot among snorkelers and scuba divers. The lava has formed underwater caves and tunnels about 15 to 45 feet (4.5 to 13.7 m) below the surface. These caves are a real thrill for experienced scuba divers. No lifeguards are stationed here. If you want to go swimming at Shark's Cove, it is a good idea to wear reef shoes because of the sharp coral reef that is everywhere in the cove. The best time to explore the cove is in the summer months when the ocean is usually calm. During the winter, getting into the water at Shark's Cove is not recommended because this is when the surf is up on Oahu's North Shore. Shark's Cove is part of an 80-acre Marine Life Conservation District. People need to respect the cove's marine inhabitants and keep the area clean.

Sunset Beach Park,"Located on the North Shore of the island, Sunset Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is one of Oahu's finest beaches for swimming and snorkeling during the summer when the water is usually calm.   During the winter the beach is a world-famous surfing spot, home to internationally renowned surfing contests. This is when the waves can reach 30+ feet (9m), which makes Sunset Beach a real surfer's paradise.Sunset Beach is at the east end of this 2-mile long sandy shore. To the west are Ehukai Beach and Banzai Pipeline, two other popular surfing beaches. Sunset Beach is also known for its powerful rip current, called the Sunset Rip, that runs on every big swell. But even when the ocean appears calm, you'll notice the strong alongshore current in the nearshore waters. You enter the ocean in one area, but a few minutes later you find yourself a little bit further down the beach. Guessing from its name, Sunset Beach has nice sunset views, especially in the summer months.

Swanzy Beach Park,"Located on Oahu's windward coast, Swanzy Beach Park (see more photos) is a good spot to camp, picnic and fish.A seawall stands at the water's edge and the nearshore ocean bottom has a shallow reef, so swimming isn't possible here. There is only a narrow strip of sand right behind the seawall. Since the name Swanzy isn't Hawaiian, one may wonder why this beach park is named like this. In the 1920s, island resident Julie Judd Swanzy donated these five acres of beachfront land to the City and County of Honolulu for a park. She had inherited the land from her father, Dr. Gerritt P. Judd. The park was officially named after her to recognize her generosity. The park also has a playground for children and picnic tables. Camping is allowed on the weekends (Friday through Sunday) and with a permit only. More info how to get a permit is here.

Three Tables Beach,"Three Tables Beach (see more photos, view panorama) got its name from the three sections of flat reef that appear on the ocean's surface during low tide. These formations make an interesting backdrop for one of the most attractive beaches on Oahu's North Shore.   The snorkeling and diving conditions are good if the ocean is calm, usually between May and September. The water is only about 15 feet (4.5 m) deep and you'll be able to see all kinds of colorful fish and underwater lava tubes, ledges and arches. Sometimes you can also see sea turtles here. In the winter, the waves can reach heights of over 20 feet (6 m) in this area. This makes for a very rough and dangerous ride and is only something for experienced surfers. The surf can be unpredictable during this season, so never turn your back to the ocean when you're in the water.

Turtle Bay,"Turtle Bay (view panorama) marks the entrance to the legendary North Shore, one of the most scenic stretches of Oahu's coastline. The bay is named after the large number of green sea turtles that inhabit the area and who used to lay their eggs in the sand on the beach years ago (however, they don't do this anymore).   Most people come to Turtle Bay for surfing, diving and fishing. There is a reef in the nearshore waters, and beyond this reef is where the surfing area begins. This is where you get some serious waves, especially in the winter months (November to February). The current can be very strong at times, so make sure to check weather conditions before venturing beyond the reef. No lifeguards are stationed here. The beach itself is sandy, but the swimming condition are poor at Turtle Bay because the nearshore ocean bottom is rocky and there is a large limestone shelf that spans almost the entire length of the bay. At the west end of the bay is a small island called Papa'amoi. The upscale Turtle Bay Resort (see more photos, view panorama) is located next to this bay. Most resort guests prefer to swim at neighboring Kuilima Cove because it offers easier access to the water (it has a sandy patch in the nearshore waters) and the beach is more protected from high surf due to an offshore reef. So overall, the beach at Turtley Bay is only sparsely visited. It is perfect if you a looking for a relaxing spot for a picnic. Ironwood trees line the backshore and provide plenty of shade. Fronting the Stables (where guided horseback riding tours are offered), there is a small Hawaiian stone altar (view photos). It is marked by a plaque that says: ""This Hawaiian altar is an 'ahupua'a demarcation between the 'ahupua'a land division boundaries of Opana-Kawela to the west and Hanaka'oe to the east. 'Ahupua'a - literally the altar ('ahu) of the pig (pua'a), it is the name for both a land division and the stone altar that serves as a marker. The 'ahupua'a system of land management was a cornerstone of traditional Hawaiian life and helped Native Hawaiians to develop one of the most sustainable methods of land use in the world. Extending from the forested mountain tops mauka (inland) or the wao akua (region of the gods), through the kula (open plains used for farming) and extending out into makai (ocean), each 'ahupua'a contained everything its inhabitants needed to sustain life.""

Turtle Beach (Papaoneone Beach),"The Hawaiian name of this beach is Papaoneone Beach, but it is more commonly known as Turtle Beach (see more photos), named after the green sea turtles who like to feed on the seaweed that grows on the reef here. They can sometimes be seen in the early morning hours just offshore.   Turtle Beach is a hidden gem on Oahu's west shore. It is not among the most popular beaches on this side of the island, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad beach. On the contrary, the almost white sand contrasts amazingly with the azure blue water. The ocean looks especially turquoise here for some reason, more than on many other Oahu beaches. On the south end of the beach is Mauna Lahilahi, a small mountain which provides a scenic backdrop. Two condominiums are also located on this side of the beach. Turtle Beach can easily be missed when driving along Oahu's west shore because it is not visible from the road. There is a small dirt parking area along the road and three narrow public access walkways lead to the ocean. The only thing Turtle Beach lacks is shade. So if you plan to come here, bring a beach umbrella. In the winter months, the surf can get very high here and this is when swimming is too dangerous. Even in the summer months there can be a strong shorebreak and currents on this beach. A sea cave, called Ulua cave, is located offshore and is a popular scuba diving location in the summer months, with a depth of around 80 feet (24 m).

Near the middle of the beach, the Ulehawa Stream crosses the beach and flows into the ocean. There are two concrete walls on either side of it that extend into the ocean. A surf site named Channels is located here. When the surf is up, strong currents form along the shoreline, which make swimming hazardous.

Located right next to Kamehameha Highway, Uppers (view panorama) is mainly visited by surfers (a surf spot called Uppers is located offshore). But the surf site isn't that good or popular.

Waiahole Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) doesn't see many visitors, mainly because the narrow beach has dark sand and the ocean is murky and brown.Swimming isn't possible here because the nearshore ocean bottom is shallow and has a reef. What this beach park does have though is nice views. In the distance you can see Chinaman's Hat Island (also known as Mokoli'i Island), and the lush Ko'olau Mountains provide a scenic backdrop.   The Waikane Pier is also visible from Waiahole Beach. The pier has been featured in numerous Hollywood movies and TV shows, including 50 First Dates, Fantasy Island and LOST. However, it is located on private property. The beach park has a large grassy area with a few trees that provide shade, but there are no picnic tables. Waiahole Beach is mainly visited by fishermen. The beach park is at the foot of Waiahole Valley, where taro was grown in the past.

The stream divides the park into two sections and a white stone bridge connects them. Wai'alae's beach sand is interspersed with coral rubble from the reef offshore. The swimming conditions aren't the best here because of the shallow reef. At the east end of the beach is a small man-made island, which was built in 1963 during the construction of the Kahala Hotel & Resort.

Waiale'e Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is mainly visited by fishermen and picnickers. When the tide is low and the ocean calm, another fun thing to do here is tidepooling. The nearshore ocean bottom is covered by rocks with sandy patches, forming small pools during low tide. The east (right) end of the beach has a rocky shelf, so entering the ocean in this area is difficult.   The beach park has a small parking lot that's accessible from the highway, but there isn't much else here in terms of facilities. The views are nice though. Offshore lies a small limestone island called Kuka'imanini, meaning “manini fish procession” in the Hawaiian language, and the name of the beach park – Waiale'e – means “rippling water.”

At the east end of the beach, on the foothills of Diamond Head, is a large and beautiful oceanfront park called Kapiolani Park. It is a great place for a picnic, ball games or running. At the west end of Waikiki Beach is the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon (also called Hilton Lagoon), which is a nice place for a relaxing swim. If you like watersports you will be able to rent all kinds of equipment on the beach, such as bodyboards, surfboards and snorkeling gear. Some of the most popular things to do at Waikiki Beach are swimming, surfing, bodyboarding, snorkeling and kayaking. Waikiki Beach is almost always crowded, and during the peak tourist seasons it can almost be difficult to find a spot where to put your towel. In the evening hours, there is music entertainment at the numerous beach bars and restaurants. Since Waikiki Beach is 2 miles long, it has several sections that have their own name. Located at the west end of Waikiki is Kahanamoku Beach, which is the widest stretch of Waikiki Beach. The area near the Kapahulu Groin (also known as The Wall) is called Kuhio Beach. This area has a breakwater, which creates a shallow and calm swimming lagoon that's ideal for families with children.

Waimanalo Beach Park,"What do you call 3 miles of sloping white sand, hundreds of towering ironwood trees and a boundless turquoise sea? For visitors, this is paradise. But for the locals of windward Oahu it is Waimanalo Beach (see more photos, view panorama). Located about a 45-minute drive from famous Waikiki Beach, Waimanalo is the kind of place that makes you blink to make sure you're not dreaming. The main attraction here is the ocean, which looks azure blue even on a cloudy day.   At around 3 miles (4.8 km) long, Waimanalo Bay is lined by the longest uninterrupted white-sand beach on Oahu. It's the perfect place for the ultimate beach stroll. Much of Waimanalo Beach is backed by ironwood trees, which provide plenty of shade. There are two main access points to the beach (two beach parks), one near the southern end of the beach and one near the northern end. The southern one is called Waimanalo Beach Park, located across from Nakini Street. This beach park has showers, restrooms, a pavilion, picnic tables and a lifeguard tower. The northern access (between Aloiloi Street and Tinker Road) leads through an ironwood forest to the Waimanalo Bay State Recreation Area. It has the same facilities and a lifeguard tower, plus a camping area where camping is allowed with a permit (more info on how to get a permit is here). Since Waimanalo Beach is located on Windward Oahu, it faces the prevailing northeasterly trade winds, which can be quite breezy. If you plan a picnic here in the winter months (November to March), you may want to bring a light jacket as it can get a bit chilly, especially if it's windy. Waimanalo Beach is known for being a good bodyboarding beach since the waves are not too high and break close to shore. Occasionally the shorebreak is very powerful here, so be cautious when entering the ocean and stick to the areas where the lifeguards are located. Did you know that Waimanalo Beach was the filming location for Magnum P.I. and Baywatch Hawaii? And even famous author James Michener wrote his novel Hawaii in Waimanalo. Also, Waimanalo Beach is a favorite place for couples who just got married to have their pictures taken. Waimanalo Beach is a silent refuge on most weekdays when you can have a good stretch of the beach to yourself. But on weekends, the grills and picnic tables get a serious workout.

Waimea Bay,"Waimea Bay (see more photos, view panorama) on Oahu's North Shore can be very different depending on the season. During the winter months (November to February) the waves in the bay can reach heights of 20 feet (6 m) and more. If they do, Waimea Bay is a very busy place and it is difficult to find a parking spot.   This is when surfers from Hawaii and around the world come here to surf and take part in world-famous surfing competitions, such as The Eddie (which only takes place when open-ocean swells reach a minimum of 20 feet, so it's a very special event that since its inception in 1984 has only taken place eight times). This surfing contest honors Eddie Aikau, a legendary big wave surfer and lifeguard at Waimea Bay who died in 1978 after the voyaging canoe Hokule'a capsized and he swam away to get help. When the surf is up at Waimea Bay, you won't even be able to get anywhere near the water. Lifeguards will put a yellow line from one end of the beach to the other to keep people away from the shorebreak. This is when only experienced surfers are allowed to enter the ocean. And even for them the winter waves and powerful currents at Waimea Bay are a challenge. During the summer months the ocean can be as calm as a lake with no waves at all. This is when swimming and snorkeling can be fun here because the water is so azure blue and clear, it's like swimming in a pool. But even then there can be strong currents that can't be seen from the beach, so obey all warning signs and stick to the center of the beach and away from the popular jumping rock. During the inbetween seasons when the surf is up but not way up it's a fun place for experienced bodysurfers and bodyboarders. The waves break very close to shore so you don't have to venture into the ocean very far to play in the waves. Overlooking Waimea Bay is one of the North Shore's most popular landmarks, the Saints Peter and Paul Church. It is located at the bay's east end and can easily be seen from the beach. The building that houses the church today used to be a rock quarry in the early 1930s, built to produce gravel for the construction of the stretch of Kamehameha Highway between Haleiwa and Kahuku. In 1953, the former machine shed and storage facility was transformed into the church you see today.

It is located a short distance just before the road ends and the trail to Ka'ena Point, the island's northwestern tip, begins. This beach is truly off the beaten path. It is one of the most remote beaches on the island and is never crowded. You need a car to get here as the City Bus only goes up to Makaha Beach. In the winter months (November to February) the beach gets pounded by high surf. This is the time when many local and visiting surfers come here to experience some thrills in the churning white water. Lifeguards are present most of the time and for good reason. The rocky ocean bottom, strong currents and high waves can be dangerous especially for beginning surfers.   The Hawaiian name for this beach is Keawa'ula, meaning ""the red harbor,"" named for the great number of squid that used to be found in the bay's nearshore waters. These squid have a bright red color when they reproduce. Most locals today refer to this beach as Yokohama Bay. Japanese fishermen in the early 1900s who came here to fish gave the beach this name, which later stuck in people's heads. Yokohama Bay has fine sand and is backed by the Wai'anae Mountain Range.

The fringing reef protects the beach from high surf and currents, so the waters here are the calmest you'll find on Kauai's north shore.   The shallow nearshore ocean bottom makes Anini a great beach to visit if you have kids. Anini Beach Park is also a snorkeler's delight - here you may spot Hawaii's state fish, the humuhumunukunukuapua'a (triggerfish) and uhu (parrotfish), kala (unicornfish) and other tropical fish. On the downside, there are some sharp corals and rocks on the nearshore ocean bottom, so take extra care when wading in. The area's consistent breeze makes for good windsurfing conditions, and it's a good spot for beginners. At the western end of the beach (near where the road ends) there is a channel where the currents can be strong, especially when the surf is up, so it's not a good idea to swim here.

Brennecke Beach,"Located next to Poipu Beach Park on Kauai's south shore, this small cove is a popular bodyboarding location. The waves are consistent here and break both further out and close to shore, so beginning and advanced bodyboarders can enjoy a ride. They also don't have to compete for waves with surfers because surfboards are not allowed at this relatively small beach.

Donkey Beach,"Some years back, Donkey Beach on Kauai's east shore was considered one of the best nudist or clothing optional beaches. But even then, the beach wasn't great for swimming, but it was popular among sunbathers who wanted it au naturel. The secluded location of this beach made it a perfect spot for nudist visitors. To get to it, one had to take a hike across a sugarcane field. Earlier owners permitted people to cut through the field to the beach.   As Donkey Beach's fame went far and wide and the sugarcane field got new owners who happened to be land developers and who didn't want to displease their high-end clients, anti-nudity laws were upped. Today, Donkey Beach continues to be visited as a good beach for sunbathing, and a convenient access walkway has been built. It is not a good beach for swimming or snorkeling since the water is choppy and rough, but when the conditions are good, the beach attracts local surfers and bodyboarders. Donkey Beach is also no longer as secluded as it had been years ago. The beach has been referred to as Donkey Beach for a long time. Most people don't know that its official name is Paliku. It was nicknamed Donkey Beach after the donkeys and mules that were herded in a pasture located next to the beach many years ago. The donkeys were owned by the Lihue Plantation Company and were used to tow bundles of seed cane.    ",,"surfing, bodyboarding",Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/donkeybeach.php
Glass Beach,"Sea glass is glass (e.g. from bottles, flasks, windshields, windows) that has been broken up and smoothened by moving ocean water and time. It takes the ocean about 10 to 30 years to create it, and the resulting fragment is a frosted, jelly bean-like pebble. Sea glass is found all over the world. Kauai's Glass Beach is located in the middle of an industrial area near Port Allen Harbor in Ele'ele. The shoreline at Glass Beach is covered with millions of sea glass pieces - brown, aqua-colored, clear and blue.   The glass originates from broken bottles and auto glass dumped here years ago. It's amazing to see what the ocean did to all this junk. The one thing that could mar the ethereal effect of Glass Beach is the gas tanks overlooking one side of the beach. Glass Beach is best for beachcombing only. Swimming is not recommended because the beach is rocky.   ",,beachcombing,Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/glassbeach.php
Ha'ena Beach Park,"This beach on Kauai's north shore is also known as Maniniholo Beach, named after the large schools of convict fish (manini fish) that feed on the coral here. Vegetated sand dunes make up the backshore of Ha'ena Beach. Offshore are two large reefs, the Makua Reef to the east and the Hauwa Reef to the west. But the beach itself is not protected by a reef; it is fully exposed to the open ocean and high surf, so swimming is hazardous except when the ocean is very calm. When the surf is up (even if just a little) there are strong currents and the waves are quite powerful here. This is when entering the ocean is not a good idea as drownings and near drownings have happened here.   Camping is allowed at Ha'ena Beach Park, but a permit is required. More info about how to get a camping permit is here. Right across from Ha'ena Beach Park is the Maniniholo Dry Cave.

Hanakapi'ai Beach,"Hanakapiai Beach is the first main destination on the Kalalau Trail on Kauai's Na Pali Coast. The beach is about 2 miles (3.2 km) into the hike and looks beautiful, offering great photo opportunities. The scenic surroundings stand in stark contrast to the beach sign with a body count on it. On a calm day, you wouldn't think that Hanakapiai is the deadliest beach on the island. Dozens of drownings have happened here. The current is so strong that some victims have never been found.   During the summer months, Hanakapiai's shore is sandy, but in the winter, the waves wash ashore and remove most of the sand from the beach. The hike to Hanakapiai is the busiest stretch on the Kalalau Trail. Most people hike up to here, since the trail continues for another long and arduous 9 miles (14.5 km) and one needs a permit to hike it all the way. Up until Hanakapiai, one doesn't need a permit. However, the hike to Hanakapiai is not easy. Especially the second mile of it is very steep. After a recent rainfall, it can be very muddy and slippery. The hike takes about 1.5 to 2 hours each way. From here, a side trail leads to Hanakapiai Falls. The side trail to the 100-foot (30 m) Hanakapiai Falls is another 2 miles (3.2 km) and is quite tough as well with numerous stream crossings. Some people reward themselves by having a refreshing dip in the pool. If you do this, step into it slowly (no head-diving into it) and be aware of rockfall (which are always possible near waterfalls and around cliffs). So if you plan to hike from Ke'e Beach all the way to Hanakaipai Falls, it's a total of 8 miles (13 km) and can easily take an entire day, especially if you plan to rest on the way. Camping is allowed at Hanakapiai Beach, but a permit is required. More info about how to get a permit is here.    ",,hiking,Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/hanakapiaibeach.php
Hanalei Bay,"At 2 miles (3.2 km) long, Hanalei Bay (see more photos, view panorama) is the largest bay on Kauai. Hanalei means “crescent bay” in Hawaiian. It is a long half moon of golden sand backed by 4,000-foot-high (1,219 m) green mountains. Look closely and you may be able to spot several waterfalls. The bay is so beautiful that the enamored Japanese author Haruki Murakami wrote a short story about it titled Hanalei Bay.   There are actually four beach parks or sections within Hanalei Bay, starting from Waikoko Beach at the bay's western end to Black Pot Beach at the bay's eastern end (near the pier). Wai'oli Beach Park and Hanalei Pavilion Beach Park are in the middle of the bay. Coral reefs grow at both ends of the bay – Pu'u Poa Reef at the left end and Waikoko Reef at the right end – while the middle part is scattered with shallow sandbars and tiny patches of coral. In summer, boats and yachts anchor in the bay. Though Hanalei Bay is generally good for a wide range of activities, from swimming to kayaking to windsurfing to yachting, it is subject to high surf and strong currents in the winter months. High surf from mid-October through March creates strong rip currents and a pounding shorebreak. Waves of 20 feet (6 m) and more are not uncommon. For surfers, the biggest waves are at a spot called Pinetrees, which is near the center of the bay. Camping is allowed at Black Pot Beach (near the pier), but a permit is required.

Hanama'ulu Bay,"Hanama'ulu Bay is located just north of Lihue Airport on Kauai's east shore. The nearshore waters of the bay are usually murky thanks to silt that enters the bay from the Hanama'ulu Stream. The beach park is therefore mainly visited by picnickers and campers. Camping is allowed here, but a permit is required. More info about how to get a permit is here. However, there have been reports of campers who found this campground unsafe in terms of suspicious activity going on at night.

Hideaways Beach,"Kauai has a number of secret gems and the appropriately named Hideaways Beach (see more photos) is one of them. It can be accessed only after a difficult climb down a very steep path. You'll have to hold on to the metal poles and ropes that have been put there as a security measure. The trail is not suitable for people who are afraid of heights (next to the trail the cliff drops off sharply) or for small children or for people with physical limitations.   There are actually two access trails to the hidden beach - the concrete pathway that leads down the cliff, which is reserved for guests of the Pali Ke Kua condominiums and which leads to the east section of the beach, and the public right-of-way trail, which is much more difficult and leads to the west section of the beach. The first section of the public trail has steep steps with a railing and after that the trail is a dirt path, which can be slippery and dangerous when wet. It takes about 10 minutes to walk (or better said, to climb) down to the beach. Also, watch out for mosquitoes. There are plenty of them on the trail. Hideaways Beach is crescent shaped and the large, grainy sand is a golden yellow where sea turtles can often be seen. Trees provide plenty of shade. Just 300 feet (90 m) long, the beach provides an intimate and secret feel. For those who know its beauty, the trek down to the beach is definitely worth it. Swimming isn't the best here because of the rocky ocean bottom, but the snorkeling conditions are good when the waters are calm. When the surf is up, the water can be murky and rip currents can form. Winter swells also tend to swallow up the narrow shoreline. There are no facilities at the beach.       ",,"fishing, snorkeling",Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/hideaways-beach.php
Honopu Beach,"It doesn't get anymore secluded and remote than Honopu Beach on Kauai's Na Pali Coast. No road or even a hiking trail leads to it. In fact, the only legal way to access it is to swim to it. Honopu actually consists of two beaches, which are backed by majestic 1200-foot (365 m) high sea cliffs and separated by the Honopu arch. Around the corner is a large waterfall, cascading down the sea cliff, through the arch and into the ocean.   Honopu means ""conch shell"" in Hawaiian. It got this name because of the conch shell-like sound that the arch makes when northerly winds blow into the valley. Another nickname of Honopu is Cathedral Beach. Trying to reach Honopu Beach is an adventure that is certainly not for everyone. Since swimming to the beach is necessary to set foot on it, one must be a very strong swimmer to reach it (and wear fins). When the surf is up, it is dangerous to enter the ocean along the Na Pali Coast because of strong rip currents and pounding surf. Also, currents can be present even if the ocean appears calm. Keep in mind that the currents usually flow in the same direction, so if you swim over to Honopu and it was easy, it may not be as easy on the way back if the current comes from that direction (which you may not have noticed on your way there). During summer when the ocean is calm, some people walk from Kalalau Beach on the exposed rocks and sand along the cliffs to Honopu Beach for most of the way. Since Honopu Valley is so isolated, it is believed to be spiritual. Many Hawaiian myths and legends tell of this area, and it is also a place of ancient burial grounds for local chiefs.

Kahili Quarry Beach,"Kahili Quarry Beach is located where Kilauea Stream empties into the Pacific Ocean on Kauai's north shore. This small beach is bordered by a densely vegetated hill and a rock quarry, which is why this beach is known as Quarry Beach or Rock Quarry Beach. The rocky quarry, which overlooks the bay, was used during the plantation days and has long been abandoned. Kahili Quarry Beach has a large pool where the Kilauea River flows into the ocean. When the ocean is calm, the pool is great for swimming. Most days, though, the nearshore water turns murky from the silt and mud carried by the Kilauea River. The beach doesn't have a reef barrier to protect it from high ocean waves. When the surf is up, it's not a good idea to swim or snorkel here. During high surf season the beach attracts surfers and bodyboarders.      ",,"swimming, fishing, surfing, bodysurfing",Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/kahiliquarrybeach.php
Kalalau Beach,"Kalalau Beach (see more photos) lies at the end of the 11-mile (17.7 km) Kalalau Trail on Kauai's north shore. The trail is one of the most difficult in the Hawaiian Islands, which limits visitors to the beach. This remote wilderness area is accessible on foot (or by boat) only. The trail begins right after Ke'e Beach and has extreme inclines and declines and narrow footpaths, especially between the dreaded 6.5 to 8 miles (10.5 to 12.9 km) into it. Not only is the trail narrow in some places, but it can also be slippery because of loose rocks or if it has recently rained. So if you're afraid of heights, you may not like this trail, especially around the middle of it.   Kalalau Beach is about 1 mile (1.6 km) long. From here, trails lead through the rest of the valley. Camping is allowed on the beach, but permits are required. Since the trail is quite long, most people who visit Kalalau Beach plan to stay overnight. There are no facilities on the beach, except for composting toilets. You need to bring all food and equipment with you. A waterfall at the western end of the beach (Ho'ole'a Falls) provides freshwater, but before drinking it, the water must be purified (bring a water filter or water treatment tablets) due to the threat of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease. Swimming is possible on Kalalau Beach, but not without dangers. Because the beach lacks a protective offshore reef to block incoming waves, high surf is common, especially during the winter months. Also, there are strong rip and alongshore currents, which may be difficult to spot, even if the ocean appears calm. The sandbar is quite shallow here and in some spots the ocean bottom drops off quickly to overhead depths. Since there are no lifeguards here and drownings have happened in the past, it is recommended to avoid swimming at Kalalau. A few people have made Kalalau Valley their permanent home, even though it is not legal. They live here because the valley is difficult to access and offers solitude and isolation. Some of these year-round residents hike out of the valley every couple of months to get supplies. Other inhabitants of the valley include feral goats. To prevent overpopulation, the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) allows hunting on weekends in August and September. For some people who come to Kalalau Beach, the long and difficult trail is not adventurous enough. Equipped with fins, they enter the water at Kalalau and swim over to the even more isolated Honopu Beach, which can only be accessed this way. To get a camping permit, visit http://www.hawaiistateparks.org/camping/permit_napali.cfm . Apply for your permit about 6-12 months in advance.

Kalapaki Beach,"Kalapaki Beach (see more photos), located in Lihue at the entrance of Nawiliwili Harbor, is one of Kauai's most popular beaches. It offers great swimming conditions as the ocean bottom is sandy and gently sloping. When the conditions are right, Kalapaki is also a good spot for beginning bodyboarders and surfers. The waves here are mostly gentle and roll across a shallow sandbar. When the surf is up (which occurs most often in winter), strong rip currents can form. The beach is backed by shops and restaurants as well as the Kauai Marriott Resort and a paved walkway with a grassy strip that is a beautiful contrast against the golden sand. Located east of Kalapaki Beach is an area with 40 acres of freshwater lagoons (known as Kauai Lagoon) and the Kauai Lagoon Golf Club. The Kauai Lagoon area is a wildlife sanctuary.

Kalihiwai Bay Beach,"Kalihiwai Beach is located at the head of Kalihiwai Bay about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the town of Kilauea on Kauai's north shore. The beach is enclosed by lava cliffs on each side and backed by ironwood trees that provide shade. The only time you can safely swim here is in summer if the ocean is calm. An alternative option is to take a dip instead in the river that crosses the beach and flows into the ocean. If you want to snorkel, try the far eastern end of the bay. However, don't expect to see as many corals and fish as you would in prime snorkeling spots such as Tunnels and Ke'e Beach.   The bay has a shallow, underwater rock shelf that extends from the cliffs, which provides one of the north shore's most popular surf breaks. Surfers gather along the rocky base of Kapukaamoi Point, the eastern point of the bay and ride to shore very close to the sea cliff. The waves in the winter months are very steep and break fast and are only something for experts. This is also when the water conditions are very dangerous due to the pounding shorebreak, powerful backwash and strong rip currents.

Kealia Beach,"Kealia Beach (see more photos) is a 150-foot (46 m) wide and 0.5-mile (805 m) long sandy beach located on Kauai's Coconut Coast (east shore). Kealia means ""salt bed"" or ""salt-encrusted area,"" a name referring to the traditional Hawaiian method of collecting and drying salt. Kealia Beach has been a site of salt mining for centuries. It is a former plantation town with a sugar mill and a train depot.   As with most Kauai beaches, the ocean conditions at Kealia Beach depend on the season. In winter, dangerous waves and strong currents characterize the beach. When the surf is up, swimming is not possible here. Kealia Beach has no reef to protect it from high swells. The beach's long sandbar often creates waves that attract surfers and bodyboarders. Surfers usually gather at the northern end of the beach where the waves are better. The northern part of the beach was once used by interisland steam ships that brought supplies for plantations. The remains of the jetty, formerly called Kealia Landing, is still visible. This area is best for swimmers or novice bodyboarders because a breakwater makes for slightly more protected waters.

Ke'e Beach Park,"Ke'e (pronounced Keh-eh) means ""avoidance"" in Hawaiian. However, this beach is far from being avoided by people. In fact, Ke'e Beach Park (see more photos) is one of the most popular beaches on Kauai. It has beautiful golden sand and marks the end of Highway 560 and the beginning of the enchanting Na Pali Coast. Coconut palms, ironwood and guava trees make for a nice backdrop.   This is also where the popular 11-mile (17.7 km) Kalalau Trail begins, so many hikers and backpackers come here (the two beach parking lots are usually quite busy). Another short trail leads to the Ke Ahu o Laka hula platform and the Kaulu Paoa Heiau, a stone temple dedicated to the goddess of hula, named Laka. But those attractions are not the only reason why Ke'e Beach is usually crowded. Nor is the reason because the beach has been featured in the popular 1983 TV series The Thorn Birds. People come here because of its clear, sandy and shallow lagoon and the reef that offers great snorkeling conditions in the summer months when the ocean is usually calm. Protected by a reef running parallel to the shore the lagoon is usually calm. Below the surface, wrasses, goatfish, convictfish, butterflyfish, damselfish, surgeonfish and other reef fish swim in abundance. Swimmers should avoid the reef channel located at the west end of the beach. The channel connects the lagoon to the open ocean. The currents can be very strong here as this is where the lagoon water flows back into the ocean. Especially when the surf is up, it is dangerous to swim in this channel. Summer months are the best time to snorkel or swim at Ke'e Beach. In winter, high surf can reach right over the reef and into the lagoon, which makes the water not only murkier, but also dangerous.

Starting from here and going north, it's 15 miles of uninterrupted sandy beach. Kekaha Beach is mainly visited by local surfers, bodyboarders and fishers. Surfers have a wide choice of surf spots: Rifle Range, Targets, First Ditch, Second Ditch, Whispering Sands, Davidson and Inters. Kekaha Beach is unprotected from the open ocean that produces powerful waves, strong rip currents and shorebreaks, making the beach unsuitable for swimming and snorkeling, especially during times of high surf.

Larsen's Beach (Ka'aka'aniu Beach),"Larsen's Beach is located in a secluded area on Kauai's northeastern shore. There is no road that leads all the way to the beach, and the one that leads near it is a dirt road, which limits visitors. The beach has a nice long stretch of sand and is backed by brush and trees.   Near the middle of the beach is a lava rock that protrudes into the ocean, known as Pakala Point, which cuts the beach in half. Right before this point is Pakala Channel, an opening in the reef through which the nearshore water flows back into the ocean. Don't go swimming in or near this channel. The rip current here is very strong and you don't want to find yourself caught in it. Swimming in general on Larsen's Beach is less than ideal. The nearshore ocean bottom is rocky and too shallow. All that's possible here is snorkeling, but not anywhere near Pakala Channel and only during calm ocean conditions and if you're an experienced snorkeler. The currents here are too unpredictable, and there are no lifeguards. Larsen's Beach is also known as Ka'aka'aniu Beach. It was named Larsen after a former manager at Kilauea Plantation named L. David Larsen. There have been issues with access to Larsen's Beach in the past. The relatively easy, gently sloping trail to the beach cuts through private property that is owned by Waioli Corp. and leased by Paradise Ranch. A fence was put up to prevent people from trespassing.

The beach is a top snorkeling destination on Kauai's south shore, located at the western end of Poipu Road next to the Beach House Restaurant. Because of that Lawa'i Beach is sometimes referred to as Beach House. The beach is sheltered by a fringing reef barrier. With little wave disturbance, snorkelers enjoy clear views particularly during calm summer months. The entry to the snorkeling spot is an easy gentle slope of sand. It has a rocky bottom that makes it great for snorkeling. Raccoon butterflies, tangs, parrotfish and sea turtles are some of the marine creatures that have made the bay their home.   Lawa'i Beach also attracts surfers and bodyboarders when the waves break against the reef. Surfers frequent three surf spots here: Acid Drop, PK's and Centers. Lawa'i is also conveniently located near popular island attractions, including Spouting Horn (a blowhole), heiaus, historical sites and botanical gardens.

Lucy Wright Beach Park,"Lucy Wright Beach Park is a historic beach. It was here where Captain James Cook first set foot in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. Curiously enough, the beach isn't called Captain Cook beach, but named after Lucy Wright, who was an active member in the Waimea community and the first native Hawaiian schoolteacher. She passed away in 1931. The beach was named in her honor.   Because the beach is located near the mouth of the Waimea River, the water is not as clear as on many other Kauai beaches. Instead of swimming, the best thing to do here is watch the river water flow into the ocean. The beach sand is a mixture of white, black and green sand. The green comes from a semi-precious gemstone called olivine, which originates from the river's lava bed. The black is lava rock from Waimea Canyon. Camping is allowed in the park, but you need to get a county permit first. More info about how to get a permit is here.

Lumaha'i Beach,"Lumaha'i Beach was made famous in the 1957 movie South Pacific. The beach is where Mitzi Gaynor ""washed that man right out of her hair."" Partly because of this history and partly because of its picturesque scenery, Lumahai has become one of the most photographed beaches on Kauai. Located just past Hanalei, this scenic beach is nearly a mile long and several hundred feet wide. Vegetated lava cliffs provide a vibrant backdrop.   While Lumaha'i Beach appears serene, there are dangers that lurk in its depths. The beach has no protective reef, making the coast totally exposed to the open ocean. Rip currents, powerful backwash, strong shorebreaks and high surf make it one of the most dangerous beaches on Kauai. On calm summer days, the Kahalahala (eastern) end of the beach may be calm enough to allow swimming. Throughout the year, the western end attracts surfers and bodyboarders, but if you're not an expert at riding Hawaiian waves, the waves are certainly not friendly.

Lydgate Beach Park,"Lydgate Beach Park (see more photos) is one of the most popular beach parks on Kauai's east shore. The park's main attraction is the large, double-sectioned pool on the northern end of the beach that is protected from ocean swells by a man-made rock barrier, which was built in 1964 using huge boulders (see history of the Lydgate pools below).   The pool is divided into an inner and an outer section by two man-made rock walls. The inner pool is shallow and ideal for children, while the outer pool is deeper and ideal for swimming and snorkeling. A lifeguard tower overlooks both pools. While water activities inside the pools are generally safe, any activity outside of this protected swimming area is not. The ocean is unpredictable, so venturing outside the pools is not safe. Lydgate Beach Park has a grass field where local residensts like to fly kites or play frisbee. South of the pools is the 16,000-foot Kalamani Playground, which was built by 7000 local volunteers in 1994. Further south is a second playground called Kalamani Kai Bridge. The bridge was designed by local keikis (children) themselves. To reach the playground, you can bike or walk down the 2.5 mile (4 km) pedestrian and bicycle path running along the coast. North of the pools are several historical sites including the remains of the Hikinaakala Heiau, a Hawaiian temple that dates as far back as 800 A.D. Next to the heiau are the remains of Hauola, a sanctuary (place of refuge) for Hawaiians who broke a taboo (who did something that was forbidden). Lydgate Beach Park was named after Rev. John Lydgate, a civic leader and former church pastor of Lihue Union Church and Koloa Church. This long and wide beach has been used as the setting for a number of films such as Diamond Head and Blue Hawaii.

A plaque has been placed at the Lydgate pools, which is a tribute to Mr. Morgan, who had the idea to build the sheltered swimming area. Here is what the plaque says:

Albert S. Morgan Sr.'s Lydgate Pools
Albert Smith Morgan Sr.
March 9, 1908 - May 22, 2001 In 1942, Albert S. Morgan, Sr. a native Hawaiian, married Helen Farias and raised five children. The family lived in the community of Wailua where Mr. Morgan served a term as president of the Wailua House Lots Community Association. As the children grew outdoor recreation became increasingly important. Mrs. Morgan frequently took the children to Lydgate Park. There was no sheltered swimming area there, but they enjoyed the beach. On a 1958 European trip Albert & Helen visited Sorrento, a town on the southwestern Italian coast. In Sorrento while viewing a beautiful bay with protected swimming areas for the people, Mr. Morgan got in inspiration. Returning to Kauai with pictures he contacted Senator Billy Fernandes. Together they prepared and presented to the State of Hawaii a proposal to create a 2.6 acre rock barrier and impoundment along Lydgate beach. In 1964, $18,000 was appropriated to build the children's wading pool and the adult's swimming pool. A crane was floated into Lydgate beach to lift and place the boulders donated by Lihu'e Plantation. The entire project was completed in nine months.

Maha'ulepu Beaches,"Even though it is just about 10 minutes from popular Poipu, the Maha'ulepu area on Kauai's south shore is pristine, beautiful and undeveloped and few visitors come here, partly because it takes a bit more effort to get here than to other more popular beaches on Kauai. Maha'ulepu actually consists of three separate beaches, known as Gillin's Beach, Kawailoa Bay and Ha'ula Beach. To get to the first beach, Gillin's, drive past the Hyatt on Poipu Road. After the road becomes dirt, there is an old guard shack. Drive past it and park in the area where the road continues to the left. From here, take the short trail to the beach. Gillin's is named after the late Elbert Gillin who built a house on this beach, which is now a vacation rental.   Near Gillin's Beach is a site known as the Maha'ulepu cave, which is actually a sandstone sinkhole and an ongoing archaeological project. It is sometimes gated off. On Sundays, there is an interpreter on site who explains what it is and how it was used as an ancient habitation site. Ancient artifacts have been found here. To reach the cave, walk past the vacation rental until you see a stream. Take the trail that follows it on its far southern side. After a two-minute walk, you'll see the sinkhole on your left. (Alternatively, it is accessible from the trail above CJM Stables). To get to the next beach, Kawailoa Bay, continue on the dirt road to the east. Windsurfing is a popular activity here. If you want to continue further to Ha'ula Beach, you need to walk along a sandy trail, which starts near the edge of the cliff. It's about a 10-15 minute walk. Because it is the most difficult to access, it is also the least visited. So on most days, you're likely to have it to yourself. The area is mainly frequented by local fishermen and occasionally by some horseback riders. Even further to the northeast, over the ridge, is Kipu Kai Beach. It is best to see this beach from a helicopter or boat because the trail over the ridge is difficult. In 1796 when King Kamehameha launched the first of his two invasion attempts on Kauai, more than 1,200 of his canoes carrying 10,000 warriors left Oahu at midnight, hoping to get to Wailua on Kauai early the next day. However, many of the canoes sank during a storm in the Kauai Channel. A few of the warriors managed to get to shore at Maha'ulepu, where most of them were killed. The ones who escaped paddled all the way back to the Big Island instead of to Oahu because they feared facing the King's wrath.

Moloa'a Bay,"Moloa'a Bay (see more photos) is one of the lesser-known beaches on Kauai, located on the island's northeastern shore. It is a pretty beach, framed by hilly dunes and green vegetation. When the ocean is calm, swimming is possible and best on the right (southeast) side of the bay. The currents in this area can be strong and since there is a lot of coral reef on the ocean bottom of the bay, it is best to enter the water with reef shoes. From the bay, a hiking trail leads along the coast toward nearby Larsen's Beach further north. Parking is very limited at Moloa'a Bay, especially on weekends. You may have to park a little further away from the beach and walk the rest to it.      ",,"swimming, snorkeling, bodyboarding",Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/moloaabay.php
Nukoli'i Beach Park,"Nukoli'i Beach Park, with its 2 miles (3.2 km) of white-sand shoreline, is the longest beach on Kauai's east shore. It starts from where Lydgate Beach Park ends and spans the area fronting the Wailua Golf Course and the Hilton Kauai Beach Resort. The beach provides poor swimming conditions because of surf and currents and because the bottom is rocky and shallow.   However, Nukoli'i Beach offers good snorkeling, scuba diving and fishing opportunities when the ocean is calm. Offshore, a reef provides shelter from waves, but not during the high surf season. Always monitor surf conditions before wading in. There is no lifeguard, so better stay out of the water particularly during the winter months. Nukoli'i Beach is sometimes referred to as Kauai Beach and sometimes as Kawailoa Beach. This is one of those Kauai beaches that never gets crowded. Most of the time it is rather deserted. Surfers can sometimes be seen here to ride the surf break called Graveyards, while beachcombers find plenty of room and shady spots for a picnic. In the 1970s, Nukoli'i Beach Park was the last beach between Lihue and Kapa'a to be developed. After years of controversies and political disputes between the county and Committee to Save Nukoli'i, a citizen's group, Nukoli'i was finally developed in 1986 as a beach park complete with facilities. That same year, the Hilton Kauai Beach Resort fronting the beach also opened.      ",,fishing,Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/nukolii-beach-park.php
Papa'a Bay,"If you have seen the action adventure movie Six Days, Seven Nights starring Harrison Ford and Anne Heche, you may recognize this beach, since it was the setting for the plane crash scene. Movie producer Peter Guber found Papa'a Bay so picturesque that he purchased all 174 acres surrounding the bay and built a large luxury oceanfront estate, which he called Tara.   In November 2009, the property was sold for a record sum of $28 million, the highest price ever paid for an existing home on Kauai. The estate had been listed for sale since 2004 with an asking price of $46 million. There have been access issues to Papa'a Bay in the past, and even a few arrests were made because people were allegedly trespassing through private property. The existing public access trail to the bay involves a 5-10 minute hike across a somewhat steep hill and through the brush and about 100 yards of boulder-hopping.

Pila'a Beach,"Pila'a Beach is a very sparsely visited beach on Kauai's north shore. It is difficult to access and since the nearshore ocean bottom is rocky, it's not a good beach for swimming. The beach is a good spot to just relax without the crowds, but since the trail to it is rocky, it's even challenging to bring a picnic basket.

Po'ipu Beach Park,"In 2001, the renowned beachologist Dr. Stephen “Dr. Beach” Leatherman, picked Po'ipu Beach Park (see more photos) as the best beach in the United States. Travel Channel also named Po'ipu Beach Park as one of America's and the World's Best Beaches. As Kauai's most popular beach, it attracts many beachgoers, yet it is never crowded in the way popular Waikiki Beach on the neighboring island of Oahu is.   Po'ipu Beach Park is a family beach and accommodates nearly every type of beach activity. Two beaches actually make up Po'ipu Beach. The eastern side is called Baby Beach because it's where keikis (kids) can swim free from dangers of big waves and strong currents. The water here is just a few inches deep and is sheltered by a jetty. On the western side of the beach, the waves break on the reef. This is the spot frequented by surfers and is also good for fishing, snorkeling, pole fishing and windsurfing. Nukumoi Point, a tombolo, separates the two bays. A tombolo is a narrow piece of land, such as a spit or a bar, extending from a shore to an island. Po'ipu Beach Park's tombolo is a favorite spot of Hawaiian monk seals; they are often found napping here in the afternoon. The area just before the tombolo, on the western side of the beach, is frequented by beginning bodyboarders. Waves here break gently on a shallow sandbar.

Polihale State Beach Park,"Polihale Beach is one of the longest continuous sand beaches in all of Hawaii, stretching 15 miles (24 km) along Kauai's west shore. The beach is also one of the widest in Hawaii, averaging 300 feet (91 m) during the summer months. It is backed by sand dunes, some of them are 100 feet (30 m) above sea level. Because of its remoteness and because of the eerie quality of its beauty, this beach has been named Polihale, which literally means “the home of the underworld (Po)” in Hawaiian. It is believed that it is here where the souls of the dead depart for Po, the underworld.   Polihale State Park encompasses 140 acres (0.5 km²) and is located at the first 2.25 miles (3.6 km) at the northern end of the beach. North of the state park are the mountain ridges of the Na Pali Coast. And to the south is the Pacific Missile Range Facility. The shoreline fronting the Pacific Missile Range Facility all the way up to Barking Sands Beach (a distance of 5 miles) has been off-limits to the public as part of a security policy since the 9/11 tragedy. Access is only allowed to people with a military ID card or a special pass that has to be applied for in advance and involves a criminal background check and costs $25. Access to Polihale State Park (the northernmost section of this coastline) is open to the public. Polihale is a wild beach characterized by rough waves and rip currents along the shore. There is no reef barrier that protects the beach from the open ocean. The only relatively safe place for a swim is at Queen's Pond, a shallow pond with a sandy bottom surrounded by a protecting reef. It is located at the southern end of the state park near where the large monkeypod tree can be seen from the dirt road (about 3.2 miles north of where Hwy 50 ends). South of Queen's Pond is Barking Sands Beach, also known as Keonekani o Nohili (The Sounding Sands of Nohili) in the Hawaiian language. If one walks over the sand here or takes two handfuls of sand in each hand and slaps it together, a sound is produced. This phenomenon occurs due to the formation of the individual sand grains. Each of them has small holes in it and the sound is produced within these small cavities through the vibrations that occur when the sand is pushed together. As mentioned above, access to Barking Sands is limited and not open to the general public as it is in a military restricted area. Since swimming is not possible at Polihale Beach on most days of the year due to rough ocean conditions, most people come here to relax, picnic, camp and enjoy the views. Camping is allowed at Polihale State Park, but a permit is required. More info about how to get a permit is here. There are no food stores in this area, so bring food and water before driving all the way out here. Local residents enjoy driving their ATVs or trucks on this beach. And since the beach is so wide and it takes a while to walk across it to get near the ocean, many simply drive their trucks onto the beach and set up camp next to their vehicle. It's a good idea to bring a beach umbrella or tent because there is no shade here and it gets hot on Kauai's leeward coast in the summer months. To reach the beach, one has to drive through a 5-mile (8 km) long somewhat bumpy dirt road. The road is graded, but is most drivable if it's dry. If it's raining or has recently rained, the road can be a muddy mess and have even more potholes. Driving to Polihale with a four-wheel drive is recommended, but it's not necessary. A regular car will be fine if the road is dry, but be careful and avoid the sandy patches and don't drive near the sand dunes or on the beach to avoid getting stuck. Also keep in mind that if you come here with a rental car and you get stuck, you'll have to pay for the tow truck. Rental car contracts usually don't allow off-road or dirt-road driving. So if anything happens to the car, the rental car insurance won't cover it.    ",,fishing,Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/polihale-state-beach-park.php
Pu'u Poa Beach,"Pu'u Poa Beach, located on the north shore of Kauai, is mainly used by guests of the St. Regis Princeville Resort and the Hanalei Bay Resort (see more photos). If you're a guest at the Hanalei Bay Resort, you can take the steep, paved path that leads to the beach or use the resort shuttle. St. Regis Princeville Resort guests can just take the elevator to the ground level. If you're not a guest at either one of the two resorts, there is a small public parking lot near the St. Regis and a beach access path (see directions below).   The beach has reddish-golden sand and extends all the way to the Hanalei River. When the tide is low, a sandbar appears extending from the river to neighboring Black Pot Beach at Hanalei Bay. The width of the shoreline is subject to changing surf, narrowing in winter and widening during calm summer months. An offshore reef protects the beach, making it generally safe for swimming and snorkeling. The reef, however, doesn't protect the beach from large winter swells that often occur between November and March. Swimming and snorkeling are discouraged during winter months. There are no lifeguards at Pu'u Poa Beach. The waves that break against the outer edge of the reef attracts surfers.

Queen's Bath,"This is not your typical sandy beach. In fact, there is no sand here at all - just rocks. Located in Princeville on Kauai's north shore, Queen's Bath (see more photos) is a natural pool surrounded by a lava shelf. There is an inlet where fresh saltwater comes in from the ocean, together with all kinds of fish.   When the surf is up, which is often times the case, the lava pool and surrounding area are extremely dangerous because the waves wash over the lava shelf. The surf doesn't even have to be high to make this area dangerous. In the past, people have been swept into the ocean who didn't even enter the water, but who were merely walking on the boulders near the water's edge. Sudden large waves can pose a danger even on calm ocean days. Even if you observe the ocean for a while and it appears calm, a sudden large wave can wash over the cliff and drag you into the ocean. For this reason, numerous warning signs have been posted in this area, which all say the same thing: ""Waves break on ledge. Stand back! You could be swept out to sea, injured and drown."" Many people don't heed the warning sings and walk near the edge of the cliff to enjoy the views. Unfortunately, more than 30 drownings have occurred here as of today, the most recent one in February 2016.

Note: The access gate to Queen's Bath will remain closed throughout the winter season due to hazardous ocean conditions.      ",,none,Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/queensbath.php
Salt Pond Beach Park,"Salt Pond Beach Park is the only place in Hawaii where salt is still produced in natural salt ponds. First, the salt ponds at the southern end of the beach are filled with ocean water and are then left to evaporate. What's left are rock crystals that are then bagged and used for cooking and medicinal purposes. Salt is produced during the dry and hot summer months.   Salt Pond Beach Park is a wide, reddish-golden sand pocket beach on Kauai's south shore that is generally safe for swimming year-round. At both ends of the beach are rocky outcrops; a natural rock ridge connects the outcrops, creating a small lagoon. This pool-like area is where families with children like to swim. The beach is usually safe for swimming, except during times of high surf, when rip currents form in the channels between the rock barriers. The area in the middle of the beach is unprotected. If you choose to swim in here, stay close to the shore. For snorkeling, the area near the lava rock outcrops - particularly the one near the salt ponds - provides excellent snorkeling opportunities. Moorish idols, goatfish, butterflyfish and unicornfish are some of the underwater creatures that can be seen here. Camping is allowed here, but you need to get a permit from the county before heading to the beach if you plan to camp. More info about camping permits is here.

SeaLodge Beach,"Located in Princeville on Kauai's north shore, SeaLodge Beach is a hidden gem. It is a small pocket of sand, surrounded by lush vegetation. Most of the time, the beach is empty because not many people know it's there. The reason is mainly access issues. If you're not a guest at SeaLodge Resort, there is basically no way that you can park anywhere near the trail to the beach. Even in the adjacent neighborhood, street parking is not allowed. They will tow your car. All parking is reserved for hotel guests. No public parking is available (we specifically called SeaLodge Resort and they confirmed this). So if you really want to visit this beach, your only options are to either take a taxi here, to park at the shopping center in Princeville and walk here (about an hour walk), or to stay at the SeaLodge Resort.   There is a reef on the nearshore ocean bottom, so it's more of a snorkeling beach rather than a swimming beach. Turtles also like this area. When the surf is up, currents often times form and the waves can be too dangerous and reach all the way to the base of the cliff. To get to the beach, you'll have to hike to it (takes about 10-15 minutes) from Building A at the SeaLodge Resort. The trail itself is scenic too and well worth it.

Secret Beach,"Also known as Kauapea Beach, Secret Beach (see more photos) is not exactly secret, but it takes a bit more effort to get to it. This fact keeps visitors limited. No road leads to it, but a 10-15-minute hike gets you here. But it is definitely worth a visit because it is one of Kauai's most scenic beaches.   Secret Beach is backed by red and black sea cliffs and lush vegetation. It stretches for 3,000 feet (915 m) and to the east offers nice views of Kilauea Lighthouse and Moku'ae'ae Island, a bird sanctuary. To the west, about a quarter mile beyond the west end of the beach, is a sizable waterfall that plunges about 15 feet (4.5 m) into the ocean. Also, there are a few other smaller waterfalls along the beach. The ocean bottom is mostly sandy and moderately steep. However, the swimming conditions vary. In the summer months when the ocean is usually calmer, swimming is possible here, but can be dangerous even then. Strong currents can be present even if the ocean appears calm, and there are no lifeguards stationed here, so be careful. In the winter months, don't think about swimming here. The trail to the beach is a bit steep and winds through brush. It is slippery on rainy days. Some people prefer to hike it barefooted because of the reddish clay that is difficult to remove from shoes and clothing. Alternatively, you can wear neoprene boots or other water shoes that are easy to wash off.    ",,limited swimming,Kauai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/kauai/beaches/secretbeach.php
Shipwreck Beach,"Shipwreck Beach on Kauai's south shore got its name from the small wooden boat that used to lie at the water's edge for many years. It deteriorated badly over the years, was hit by storms and people stripped it for firewood. When hurricane ‘Iwa hit Kauai in November 1982, it completely destroyed what little remained of the already dismantled boat.   The Hawaiian name of this beach is Keoneloa, meaning ""the long sands."" There are some ancient petroglyphs that have been carved into the beachrock shelves here. However, they are covered under sand and are only exposed during very strong southwesterly winter storms, which strip away enough sand to uncover these carvings. The most prominent feature of Shipwreck Beach is Makawehi Point, a sandstone cliff at the eastern end of the beach. Shipwreck Beach is about 0.5 miles (800 m) long and and known for its good bodyboarding and windsurfing conditions. Surfers and windsurfers enter the water at the eastern end of the beach near the cliff. During times of high surf, strong rip currents and a powerful shorebreak make swimming dangerous.

Tunnels Beach,"Tunnels Beach (aka Makua Beach) located at Ha'ena Point on Kauai's north shore is a postcard-perfect stretch of golden sand backed by ironwood trees, tropical palms and lush mountains. Even though much of the shoreline is lined by beachrock, which is usually not favored by swimmers, Tunnels Beach is nevertheless one of the north shore's most popular beaches.   One of the main attractions is the large reef offshore. The beach is unique for having an inner and an outer reef. About an eighth of a mile offshore is a half-moon shaped reef. This is the inner reef and it is shallow. This area is ideal for novice snorkelers, while advanced divers and snorkelers explore the outer reef, which has more lava tubes, arches and coral formations. During the winter months or times of high surf, the water conditions are hazardous at Tunnels Beach and swimming and snorkeling are dangerous. A popular surf break called Tunnels is located at the outer edge of the reef, which is visited by both surfers and windsurfers. It is for experts only. A wide channel lies between the two reefs.

Wailua Beach,"Wailua Beach is a wind-swept, half-mile long white-sand beach located at the mouth of the Wailua River on Kauai's Coconut Coast (east shore). With no reef to protect the beach against open ocean swells, the surf is usually up – all the reason why surfers and bodyboarders love Wailua Beach. This is despite the fact that the water tends to be murky because of the river water entering the ocean here.   Due to its poor water quality and exposure to the open ocean, the swimming conditions are poor. Also, the river and the ocean are always clashing, creating strong rip currents and powerful shorebreaks. What the beach is lacking in terms of water activities, Wailua River makes up for it. It's a popular visitor destination. Kayak and boat tours and hiking expeditions up the Wailua River are offered by nearby businesses.

The beach has no reef to shelter it from large ocean swells. Anyone who dives into the ocean here has to deal with dangerous rip currents, a powerful backwash and strong shorebreak. A few drownings and near-drownings have happened here in the past. Wainiha River flows into the ocean at the eastern end of the beach.

Swimming here is only possible when the ocean is calm and even then it is not that good because the ocean bottom is rocky in most areas. The surroundings are beautiful and on the southern end of the beach is a small cove where sea turtles can often be seen near the rocky outcropping. A public access trail leads from the road to this cove. There is also a paved trail along much of the rest of the beach.   Further north is Waipouli Beach Park, which is not as scenic as Waipouli Beach. It is a gathering spot among local residents. There is a boat ramp and a pedestrian bridge that leads over a stream to the neighboring Kapa'a Beach Park. The swimming at Waipouli Beach Park is good when the ocean is calm.

Crystal clear waters invite snorkelers to observe the brilliant reef marine life below, a testament to the success of the marine life conservation district here. Hulopo'e Bay is a protected marine preserve, so visitors are asked to take only pictures and leave only bubbles. Also, no ship is allowed to anchor in this bay.

Polihua Beach,"If you’re in the mood of a little adventure, then the white sand Polihua Beach won’t disappoint. Located on Lanai’s northwestern end, Polihua requires the assistance of a four-wheel drive vehicle to maneuver the rugged, four-mile-long trail that leads here. Polihua Beach is over 1.5 miles long and is the longest white sand beach on Lanai. Characterized by rough waters and high winds, Polihua is more of a scenic beach rather than an interactive one. The winds are sometimes so strong they create sand storms, so if you go here on a windy day you’ll most probably get sand blown all over yourself. On windless days, this beach is a good spot for sunbathing, picnicking and picture-taking. On a clear day, you can see across the Kalohi Channel all the way to Molokai or even to Oahu’s Diamond Head.   Swimming and ocean sports are not recommended here due to the unpredictable surf and strong currents. The nearshore ocean bottom is steep and drops off sharply to overhead depths. Furthermore, Polihua Beach is completely exposed to the open ocean. It has no protective reef or rocks. The powerful alongshore current is always strong and will easily sweep you out to sea, even on a calm day. So no matter how calm the ocean looks, swimming is not safe here at any time of the year. Polihua, which means “egg nest” in the Hawaiian language, was once one of the most famous green sea turtle nesting beaches in Hawaii. Although the endangered green sea turtles are slowly making a comeback, they are hardly seen here now. You’re much more likely to see whales if you come in the winter months. They often pass by very close to shore. To get to Polihua Beach, start at the Garden of the Gods and head “makai” (toward the ocean). At the trail’s end, just a short hike from your parking spot you’ll be rewarded with vast sand dunes shaped expertly by the relentless ocean-driven winds. Despite the lack of ocean activities at Polihua Beach, many visitors love the remoteness of it and appreciate the unique and beautiful landscape.

Shark's Bay,"Shark's Bay is a secluded, yet easily accessible area on Lanai's south shore (a trail from Hulopoe Bay leads here). Since Hulopoe Bay is the most popular beach on the island (the Four Seasons Resort at Manele Bay is located on Hulopoe Bay), some resort guests enjoy taking this short beach trail to neighboring Shark's Bay, one of the most scenic spots on Lanai. The bay has red lava cliffs and on the bottom of the cliffs is a small sandy cove. From above the cliffs you can enjoy great views of Pu'u Pehe, also known as “Sweetheart Rock,” a picturesque 80 foot-tall (24 m) rock jutting out of the ocean and located 150 feet (46 m) offshore. Pu'u Pehe is the subject of a famous Hawaiian legend and is also said to be the site of an ancient bird heiau (temple). Swimming is discouraged at Shark's Bay due to the strong currents and a rocky ocean bottom. Facilities (showers and restrooms) are accessible next door at Hulopoe Beach.

Shipwreck Beach,"Shipwreck Beach on Lanai, also known as Kaiolohia (see more photos), is known for its shallow reef and strong currents. It has wrecked many ships in the past, hence its name. The Alderman Wood, a British vessel got into trouble and sank here in 1824 – which is the first documented shipwreck. Two years later, the London, an American ship, met its fate. The London was believed to have gold and silver on board, and it is uncertain how much of it was ever recovered.   The shipwreck after which this beach is named that can still be seen today is popularly referred to as a World War II Liberty Ship. However, it is a ferrocement (reinforced concrete) gasoline barge built for the Navy in 1943. Instead of a name, these type of ships were just given a number designation. This particular ship was YOGN 42. It was purposely grounded. After the war ended, this was the most economical way to dispose of the vessel. Shipwreck Beach is a remote beach on Lanai's north shore, and besides a few green sea turtles sunning themselves on the beach and maybe a lonely fisherman, there's only peace and quiet here. A short walk past the Shipwreck sign, there is a trail that leads about 200 yards (180 m) inland to the Kukui Point petroglyphs. The white, sandy beach is a beachcomber's delight, revealing shells, rocks and odd debris thanks to the strong winds and slamming waves that pound the shore. Stroll the 8 miles (13 km) of Shipwreck Beach and hike up the overlooking hill for a one-of-a-kind view. A once-functional lighthouse nearby lies in ruins, adding to the ancient feeling of the scene. Due to the strong currents, only highly-experienced surfers and bodyboarders should brave these waters.    ",,"fishing, picnicking",Lanai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/lanai/beaches/shipwreck-beach.php
Awahua Beach,"This scenic beach is located on Molokai's Kalaupapa Peninsula. The peninsula is backed by the world's tallest sea cliffs. Because of its remoteness and the fact that it is difficult to access, those inflicted with Hansen's disease (leprosy) were forced to live in exile here between 1866 and 1969. Today, the peninsula is home to a few surviving Hansen's disease patients.

A narrow trail leads down from the Pala'au State Park on top of the cliffs to the peninsula below. However, visitors have to join a tour group that is led by a guide. Alternatively, you can see the beach from a public lookout that is located next to the trailhead, 1,664 feet (507 m) above the peninsula.   Because Kalaupapa is difficult to access and either involves a hike or mule ride, Awahua Beach doesn't see many visitors. The beach is composed of detrital sand, which appears black. It is therefore also known as Black Sand Beach. The swimming conditions are poor here. There is no protective reef and the nearshore ocean bottom drops off quickly. Strong rip currents make swimming hazardous.     ",,none,Molokai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/molokai/beaches/awahuabeach.php
Dixie Maru Cove (Kapukahehu Beach),"Located on Molokai's west shore, Dixie Maru Cove (see more photos, view panorama) has one of the best swimming beaches on the island. The protected sandy cove features lava outcroppings on each side and is a nice place to enjoy the water, whether it's for a relaxing swim or snorkeling. Fringed by a reef, the beach usually has calm waters during the summer. This is when the swimming and snorkeling conditions are the best. Even though the bay is more protected than the other beaches in this area (such as nearby Papohaku Beach), stay out of the water if the surf is up. There are no lifeguards here.   Dixie Maru Cove got its name ""Dixie Maru"" from a Japanese fishing boat name plate. In Japanese culture, ""maru"" is a suffix added by sailors to their ship names as this term connotes something that is beloved. The term ""maru"" in itself represents a sense of perfection. It was in the 1920s when the Japanese sailboat Dixie Maru was wrecked off the shore and its name plate was then hung near the beach's gate. From then on, the remote beach has been fondly called Dixi Maru Cove. Its Hawaiian name is Kapukahehu Beach. Dixie Maru Cove takes some time to get to as it is located on Molokai's remote west shore. However, the road that leads here is paved. On most days the beach is only sparsely visited. The beach is backed by thorny kiawe trees, so be careful when looking for a shady spot under one of the trees. Editor's note: Last time we visited Dixie Maru Beach one of us stepped into a big fish metal fishhook (see here), luckily wearing running shoes. It was really difficult to remove the hook from the shoe. So it is a good idea to wear shoes here to protect your feet from any discarded fishhooks, as well as the thorns from the kiawe trees that are plentiful on most beaches in this area.

Halawa Beach,"Comprised of two equally beautiful beaches, Kama'alaea Beach to the west and Kawili Beach to the east, Halawa Beach Park is located in gorgeous Halawa Bay on Molokai's east shore. Both beaches are detrital sand beaches and are backed by low sand dunes. The remote bay is a good spot for sunbathing, fishing and picnicking. The inshore waters of Kama'alaea Beach are shallow and mostly safe for swimming, except when there's a strong rip current that occurs during times of heavy surf. There's a small reef patch in the middle of the beach, however, the water is usually murky, which limits snorkeling. Mountain rainwater is carried by Halawa Stream to meet the ocean at the east end of the beach.   Kawili Beach is not as protected from the open ocean and therefore, very strong currents occur when the surf is up. On calm days, swimming is usually safe. There are some rocks on the ocean bottom here. Legend has it that in the old Hawaii, the Molokai chiefs enjoyed surfing at Halawa Beach. Today, the beach remains a popular surf spot during the winter when the waves are big. If you're planning on taking a trip to Halawa Beach Park, take Highway 450 (Kamehameha Highway) all the way to its east end. After you cross the bridge, follow the rough road trail until you reach the gravel parking area. Up ahead is the beach park. Bring drinking water because there is no water available at the beach park. There are no concession areas either, but restrooms and picnic pavilions are available.

Hale O Lono Beach,"Hale O Lono, or ""House of Lono,"" is a long and narrow white-sand beach on Molokai's south shore. It was once a heiau, or a place of worship, for Lono, who is the god of agriculture and fertility. Food and gifts were offered to Lono, as the people prayed that Lono will grant them abundant crop growth as well as prosperity both on land and sea. Although the land near the beach is owned by Molokai Ranch (they stopped operating, but still own the land nearby), Hale O Lono Beach is open to the public. It is located at the Hale O Lono Harbor, where the annual Molokai Hoe (an outrigger canoe competition from Molokai to Oahu) starts. Due to the rocks and stones on the ocean bottom, swimming and snorkeling are less popular activities on the beach. Fishing is good though. Also, the beach is a prime spot for whale watching between December and April.   There are no lifeguards and restroom facilities at Hale O Lono Beach. To get to the beach, take Highway 460 towards Maunaloa. Once you reach the sharp curve at the pineapple exhibit, turn right towards the dirt road a little past Mokio Street. Go all the way down south until you come to a branched road. Take the left and there you'll find the beach park.

Kakahai'a Beach Park,"Kakahai'a Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) is a small roadside park located on Highway 450 on Molokai's south shore. It is also known as the Kakahai'a County Park and National Wildlife Refuge. The name Kakahai'a means ""fish slicing"" in Hawaiian. It's the name of an ancient inland fishpond. However, the pond is overgrown with bullrushes and is not in use today. Kakahai'a Beach is a narrow, detrital sand beach and is not suitable for swimming or snorkeling because the ocean bottom is rocky, shallow and the water generally murky. It's primarily visited by fishermen and picnickers. However, a good thing to do here is bird watching, since part of the beach is actually a bird sanctuary. The National Wildlife Refuge, where the beach is located, is home to the Hawaiian Stilt and the Hawaiian Coot. These birds are an endangered Hawaiian native species.   The Hawaiian Stilt - also known as the Ae'o - is a slim, wading bird that has a black and white forehead. There used to be a lot of these birds in existence, but today their number has dropped down to a tragic 1,500. The Hawaiian Coot, or the Fulica Alai, is dark gray in color and the male and female species look alike. They are usually found in lowland valleys. Today, there are an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 Hawaiian Coots in existence all over the Hawaiian Islands.     ",,fishing,Molokai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/molokai/beaches/kakahaiabeach.php

Kaupoa Beach,"Located on the west shore of Molokai, Kaupoa Beach is made up of two beaches shaped like crescent moons and beautified by white sands, crystal clear waters and dark lava rocks. The two beaches are divided by a rocky outcrop in the center. The inshore ocean bottom is mostly sandy, but drops quickly do overhead depths. The swimming and snorkeling conditions are excellent here, especially in the summer months when the waters are usually calm. You can meet a variety of marine life up close as you explore the many tide pools on the beach. During the winter months when the surf is up, swimming is not recommended because the water can get turbulent.   Numerous shipwrecks have occurred in this area in the past. One of them was the Carrier Dove, an American four-masted, 800-ton cargo ship, which was on its way from Tonga to Canada. On November 4, 1921, the ship hit the rocky coast near Kaupoa Beach at night and broke up within just a few hours. The Carrier Dove had an interesting history. Before her final day, she had survived violent storms, pirate attacks and two former groundings. There used to be 40 tentalows (small cabins) where one could camp, known as the Kaupoa Beach Village, but it closed in 2008 when the owner, Molokai Ranch, ceased operations.

Kepuhi Beach,"Kepuhi Beach (see more photos, view panorama), located on Molokai's west shore, is a long and wide sandy beach. On the southern end of the beach is Kaiaka Rock, which was once the location of a heiau (Hawaiian temple). Even though the beach looks inviting, swimming is only possible here on very calm days because of strong alongshore currents that can be treacherous. In the winter months or when the surf is up, the entire length of the beach gets pounded by high waves with dangerous shorebreaks. This is when powerful rip currents occur.   Sometimes the waves are good enough for bodyboarding or surfing, but only for experts. During extended periods of heavy surf, the waves often times erode the beach and flush the sand out to sea, exposing large beach rocks. Kepuhi Beach has two sections, which are devided by a few large lava rocks along the shoreline. The northern part is smaller and doesn't have exposed rocks on the shoreline. The longer southern part has exposed beach rocks.         ",,"limited swimming, bodyboarding, surfing",Molokai,https://www.to-hawaii.com/molokai/beaches/kepuhibeach.php
Kiowea Beach Park,"Kiowea Beach Park (view panorama) is located right next to a well-known coconut grove, known as Kapuaiwa or Kamehameha Coconut Grove, on Molokai's south shore. It is named in honor of the high chief Kapuaiwa, who in 1863 became King Kamehameha V. It is said that either he himself planted the coconuts in this grove, or that the trees were planted by his agent and ranch manager, Rudolph W. Meyer. Kiowea Beach is narrow and composed of detrital sand. The ocean bottom is rocky, shallow and the water murky, so the swimming conditions are poor. The shoreline here is quite eroded. In the past, there had been several freshwater springs in the park, but because of erosion, they are now located in the ocean offshore. They can be seen bubbling up at low tide.

Mo'omomi Beach,"Located on Molokai's northwestern coast, Mo'omomi Beach and the surrounding area that extends inland feature one of the most impressive sand dunes in Hawaii. Since this side of the island is exposed to the tradewinds during most of the year, the wind carries the sand from the Mo'omomi shoreline and surrounding beaches inland, expanding the sand dunes even further. These massive sand dunes have been formed over centuries, extending inland for more than 4 miles (6.4 km) in some areas. That's why this deserted, sandy region is also called the Desert Strip, or in the Hawaiian language it is referred to as Keonelele, “the wind-blown sands.” This stretch of coastline was once a popular fishing area. The entire area is part of the Mo'omomi Preserve, which is managed by the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. The nature preserve is a 921-acre (3.7 sq. km) sanctuary for 22 native species of Hawaiian plants. The conservancy offers regular hiking tours into the area. Call 808-553-5236 for more information. Reservations are required, but there is no fee.   If you want to go on your own, the trail begins at the Hawaiian Home Lands area, located in the east of the preserve. However, going to the beach can be quite a feat in itself, as the path leading to Mo'omomi is a dirt road that is almost impassable unless you drive a four-wheel vehicle. Parking is only allowed in designated areas and since this is a nature preserve, you'll have to stay on the trail. The sand dune area is fragile and protected by the preserve and no one should enter it. Also, all corals, shells, stones, plants and whatever else is there must be left in its place. For many longtime residents of Molokai, Mo'omomi Beach encompasses the entire 3-mile (4.8 km) stretch of coastline from the Hawaiian Home Lands center to ‘Ilio Point. However, there are three different beaches in this area, Mo'omomi, Keonelele and Kawa'aloa. Mo'omomi Beach is a small pocket of white sand, located at the Hawaiian Home Lands Recreation Center. The bay is shallow and rocky and not a good spot for swimming or other water activities besides fishing. Also, sharp rocks, strong currents and high surf, especially in the winter months, make swimming dangerous.

Murphy's Beach,"Murphy's Beach (view panorama) on Molokai's southeast shore is a narrow white-sand beach shaded by a few palm trees. The beaches along Molokai's south shore (when driving east from Kaunakakai) aren't great swimming beaches because the nearshore ocean bottom is shallow and the water murky. However, Murphy's Beach is an exception. When the ocean is calm, the water is clear here and the ocean looks inviting for a refreshing dip. The swimming conditions are fair since the nearshore ocean bottom is shallow and rocky, with a few sandy patches inbetween. But the snorkeling can be good on calm days. Stay close to shore because outside of the reef area the currents can be treacherous. The beach is also a good fishing spot.   Beyond Murphy's Beach the road becomes even narrower (Kamehameha Highway turns into a one-land road about 2 miles before Murphy's Beach), so many visitors or those on a tight schedule (as well as larger tour vans) drive only up to Murphy's Beach and then turn around. There is a small parking area that overlooks the beach, which is a popular lookout point. Pictures taken from here grace quite a few Hawaiian wall calendars. Since Murphy's Beach is 20 miles east of Kaunakakai, it is also known as Twenty Mile Beach or Mile Marker 20 Beach.

The beach in both areas is narrow and the nearshore ocean bottom is shallow and rocky and the water murky, so the swimming conditions are poor. The beach park is mainly visited by fishermen and picnickers. There is enough space for family gatherings and the large lawns are perfect for ball games. In the Hawaiian language, oneali'i means ""royal sands."" The beach park is named after an ancient Hawaiin fishpond.

Other than that there isn't much to do here. Access is via a beach access road from Pohakuloa Road. There is no sign with the beach name on it, only a sign that says “Beach Public Right-of-Way,” so the beach is easy to miss if you don't have a map with you and therefore don't know which beach access road to take.

Papohaku Beach,"Spanning a distance of 2 miles (3.2 km) long and 100 yards (91 m) wide, Papohaku Beach (see more photos, view panorama) on the west shore of Molokai is one of the longest and widest white-sand beaches in the Hawaiian Islands. Low sand dunes and thorny kiawe trees make up the backshore. It is a great beach for a long shoreline stroll. Even though the beach looks inviting, swimming isn't safe here due to strong rip currents. Papohaku Beach doesn't have a protective reef, so it is fully exposed to the open ocean. Strong surf can occur at any time of the year. Since nothing blocks the waves, they break forcefully and can wash up high on the beach, which can pose a danger to anyone walking near the water's edge, especially children. Occasionally, experienced bodyboarders go out and surf here, but this is not a beach for other water activities.   On windy days it can be unpleasant to picnic here or to lie down on a towel on the beach because the wind will blow the sand all over you. Even on moderately windy days, the wind will blow the sand all the way up to your chest. For many years in the past, Papohaku Beach was the location of the largest sand mining operation in Hawaii. In the early 1960s, sand was taken from here and shipped to neighboring Oahu for use by the construction industry. This operation ended in 1975. A concrete tunnel on the beach is all what remains of the former sand mining industry. Papohaku Beach was also the location of military exercises during World War II. Up until today, there are some wire rolls and other pieces of metal and even some abandoned vehicles partially buried in the middle of the beach at the water's edge, which are sometimes exposed during times of heavy surf. These objects can pose another hazard to beachgoers. Editor's Note: Papohaku Beach is backed by a kiawe tree forest. Kiawe trees have thorns (see here), so be careful when looking for a shady spot under a kiawe tree. Before sitting down, make sure there are no thorns in the sand. The thorns, which are up to one inch (2.5 cm) long, are also not very pleasant to step into. Wear shoes when walking from the parking area to the beach.

Pohakumauliuli Beach,"Located on Molokai's west shore, Pohakumauliuli Beach (see more photos, view panorama) features two white-sand beach coves and a few large tide pools. The remote coves are good spots for sunbathing, but the swimming conditions are poor due to strong currents. Also, there are some large boulders right at the water's edge which can pose a hazard during times of high surf.   The nearby hill is a large cinder cone called Pohaku Mauliuli, which means “black rock” in the Hawaiian language. The cinder rock is quite loose in some parts and occasionally falls off into the sand below. The base of the hill is therefore not a good spot for walking or sunbathing and should be avoided. Pohakumauliuli Beach is also known as Make Horse Beach. In the past, when there was a ranch on Molokai's west shore, an old horse fell off the cliff here and died on the beach. In the Hawaiian language, ""make"" means dead. To get to Pohakumauliuli Beach, walk north along the shoreline from neighboring Kepuhi Beach. A waterfront golf course used to be located here and the golf cart trail is still visible. After a 5-10 minute walk you'll reach the first cove. The two coves are separated by a boulder hill.

Parts of the beach as well as the nearshore ocean bottom are covered by lava rocks. It is therefore more suitable for a peaceful picnic rather than a swimming destination. When the ocean is calm (usually in the summer months) this beach sometimes attracts snorkelers. In the winter (November to March), the surf can be up. Access to the beach is via a paved beach access road, which can easily be missed.

Sandy Beach,"Sandy Beach (view panorama) on Molokai's east shore is a small roadside pocket of sand and one of the best swimming beaches on the island. The nearshore ocean bottom is deeper here than on many other Molokai beaches, so it's easier to enter the water without having to walk on reef and rocks. The water is also clear here while many other beaches on Molokai's south and east shore have murky water. There is a reef a little further offshore, which protects the beach from strong currents. However, a rip current occasionally forms along the south point of the beach. Sandy Beach, located after Rock Point near mile marker 22, is the last sand beach before Halawa Beach Park.

Here you can find artifacts showing how Hawaiians lived in the past, before the time of James Cook and the civilization that followed suit. Surrounding the beach is the Ai'opio Fish Trap, a primitive pond designed for catching fish. Built by ancient island villagers, it traps the fish that come in at high tide and get trapped at low tide, so it makes for an easy catch. All that remains today is the dark lava structure around the trap, but it continues to fascinate locals and visitors alike. The beach is safe for swimming, even for small children who can play in the shallow tide pools. Offshore reefs are scattered throughout the area, which acts as a buffer for incoming waves and currents. Occasionally, turtles will swim up to shore and feed on the limu (seaweed).

During times of calm waters, the snorkeling conditions are excellent here. The beach is a popular take-off point for offshore divers and snorkelers. At the far side, you will find dark rock walls that plunge 45 feet (13.7 m) into the water, creating a natural shelter for the colorful fish that inhabit the area. These walls also shield the beach from the tides, making it calmer for swimmers and paddlers. Alula Beach is part of the Kalolo-Honokohau National Historic Park, a 1160-acre (4.7 sq. km) preserve dedicated to Hawaiian culture and history.

It features a long white-sand beach, several tide pools, fishponds and a large grove of coconut palms. You'll also find it better equipped than its neighbors, with restrooms, showers and a parking lot conveniently located nearby. Like many of the Big Island beaches, Anaeho'omalu is protected by an offshore reef. The ocean bottom drops off gently here, and the beach is popular for a variety of ocean sports, including swimming, snorkeling, windsurfing, scuba diving and surfing. Dangerous ocean conditions may occur during storms or high surf.   Located just behind the beach are two ancient Hawaiian fishponds, named Ku'uali'i and Kahapapa (Ku'uali'i is the larger of the two). The ponds were once used by Hawaiian royalty to raise mullet and other small fish. They were maintained by the fishermen who lived in this area, and the fish that were raised here were only given to royal people. That's probably why this beach was named Anaeho'omalu, which means ""restricted mullet"" in the Hawaiian language. The area is surrounded by educational plaques offering interesting tidbits of Hawaiian history. Now a favorite among photographers, the ponds boast interesting colors and look simply spectacular during sunset. If you'd like to explore a bit, you can hike the nearby King's Trail, which leads through a 2-acre (8,094 sq. m) historical park featuring rock shelters, petroglyphs (rock carvings) and other ancient artifacts. Another trail will take you to the Hilton Waikoloa and other luxury hotels. In March 2011, Anaeho'omalu Bay was damaged by a tsunami wave that was caused by the devastating earthquake in Japan. The tsunami literally sliced Anaeho'omalu Bay into two pieces and broke the wall of the ancient Ku'uali'i Fishpond. Up until today, repair work is still in progress (see photos). The 100-foot gaping hole in the beach has been fixed, but the ancient rock wall has yet to be restored. This damage has also had a profound effect on the fishpond.

The small bay has deep offshore waters and dangerous water conditions develop during times of high surf. The ocean bottom drops off quickly here and rip currents often times run from the bay into the open ocean. However, the bay is sometimes used by surfers. At the head of the bay, Hakalau Stream flows into the ocean, so the inshore waters are always murky. The beach is composed of black sand and fine pebbles. The town of Hakalau was once home to a thriving sugar industry and an important stop for local transport. Remnants of its prosperous past can still be seen in the old railroad bridge that leads to the bay and the long-defunct plantation towers you can see from the road. Also located on the shoreline are the ruins of Hakalau Mill, which was destroyed in the tsunami of 1946.   If you’d rather stay out of the water, you can check out the nearby Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. This 33,000-acre (134 sq. km) area is home to a large collection of native flora and fauna. Some of them are extremely rare and can only be found here. The park is also the first park built in the U.S. solely for the protection of forest birds.    ",,surfing,Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/hakalaubay.php
Hapuna Beach State Park,"Hapuna Beach Park (view panorama) is one of the real gems on the Big Island. Conde Nast Traveller, a prestigious travel magazine, has repeatedly voted it the best beach in the U.S. Golden white sands and clear, deep blue waters make this beach a popular spot for weddings, photo and video shoots and beach parties. The white-sand beach is 0.5 miles (800 m) long and about 200 feet (60 m) wide and is surrounded by a beautifully landscaped park, coconut palms and many public facilities. Beaches like Hapuna are rare on the Big Island, where most beaches are made up of lava rock, pebbles, black sand and sea cliffs, instead of soft white sand. The ocean bottom drops off gently here. At the northern end of the beach is a shallow, sand-bottomed cove with calm water where novice snorkelers like to mingle. At the southern end of the beach, there are some sea cliffs from where some people like to jump into the ocean. The snorkeling conditions here are also best because there is a small coral reef in this area. But generally speaking, there are better places for snorkeling on the Big Island. Both ends of Hapuna Beach are marked by large rocks that serve as lookout points during sunset. Always check the weather conditions before stepping into the water. While the area is generally calmer during the summer months, high surf is common during the winter months, which makes entering the ocean unsafe. Lifeguards are only on duty from time to time, so use the general rule of thumb: ""If in doubt, don't go out.""

Hilo Bay Beachfront Park,"With close to 3,000 feet (914 m) of coastline, Hilo Bay Beachfront Park is one of the longest beaches on the Big Island of Hawaii. But it’s surprisingly uncrowded. The culprit? A heavy industrial boom in the mid-1900s that has left the waters murky and the shores polluted due to sewage and industrial waste that was dumped into the ocean. The past two decades have seen tremendous efforts by the government to restore the area. It’s still a work in progress, but on a good day, you can already glimpse some of Hilo Bay’s former glory. It was once considered to be one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. Nevertheless, it is still a nice place for a picnic and a popular surfing, fishing and canoeing beach.   Swimming is not very popular, as the water hasn’t quite gained back its clear blue shade and is colder than on other beaches due to the discharge of freshwater from the nearby rivers. Nevertheless, the shore makes for a nice viewing spot, especially during sunset. It is a black sand beach and the unique color adds a lot of interest to the scene. Much of Hilo Bay is a protected area, as there is some interesting marine wildlife around. It takes some luck and patience to spot some of the fish, but it’s certainly worth it. Most of them hang around far from shore, where there’s quite a bit of leftover sewage. Try paddling past the first few meters and they just might make an appearance. Hilo Bay Beachfront Park is well-furnished despite its current condition. On the shore, you’ll find a number of picnic tables and shaded areas. Restrooms and showers can be found further back, as well as a few beach shops.

Holoholokai Beach Park,"Holoholokai Beach Park (view panorama) on the Big Island is not your typical picture-perfect white-sand beach. This rocky strip of coastline boasts something completely different, but just as fascinating: a walk through prehistoric Hawaii, told in the words of ancient art. The beach is next to the Malama Petroglyph Trail leading to the Puako Petroglyphs, the largest collection of petroglyphs in Hawaii. With a good eye, you can spot more than 3,000 of these age-old drawings etched onto larger-than-life boulders. Of course, the beach itself is not to be missed. Many visitors to the trail also visit this beach to relax, picnic or take pictures. There is more rock than sand on Holoholokai Beach, but the black lava rocks mixed with white coral rubble make for interesting beach scenery. It's not a good beach for swimming because the nearshore ocean bottom is rocky, which makes entering the ocean difficult. Besides the rock outcroppings, the occasionally high surf can make it dangerous even for experienced swimmers. In the park area you’ll find picnic tables, BBQ grills, lots of trees and grassy areas for ball games. Restrooms and showers are also conveniently located in the park.

Honaunau Bay,"A former stronghold of Hawaiian chiefs, Honaunau Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii has some of the best underwater sights on the island, if not the entire state. Rare fish and sea turtles can be seen playing amidst colorful coral reefs. On a clear summer day, you don’t even need to swim too far to get a good view. The water is especially inviting to snorkelers and scuba divers, as it is clear and calm throughout the year. The beach is also known as “Two Step” because it has two natural steps in the lava flow to enter and get out of the water. Next to the beach is the Puuhonua O Honaunau Park, an important cultural and historical site. It once served as a refuge for prisoners of war and a place of judgment for people who went against the law. Today, this notable past is celebrated in a 180-acre (0.7 sq. km) historical park frequented by locals and visitors alike. Facilities are scarce on the beach itself, but you’ll find most of the basics in the park area. Lifeguards aren’t always on duty.

Honoka'ope Beach,"Located at the south end of the Mauna Lani Resort area, Honoka'ope Beach (view panorama) is a small salt-and-pepper beach that's only sparsely visited. The beach is backed by several luxury homes, and access to Honoka'ope requires getting a beach access pass at the gate (there are 20 parking spaces). When the ocean is calm, snorkeling is possible here, and since the other resort beaches in this area are sandy, Honoka'ope makes for an interesting change. From Honoka'ope Beach, a trail leads north along the lava cliffs to 49 Black Sand Beach.     ",,"swimming, snorkeling",Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/honokaopebeach.php
Honokohau Beach,"Honokohau Beach, located on the Big Island’s west shore, is a long salt-and-pepper sand beach, with fragments of ground-up seashells, coral and lava rock. There’s a low lava shelf at the water’s edge that lines most of the shore. The nearshore ocean bottom is shallow and rocky, and an offshore fringing reef shelters the beach from strong surf and currents. This is a good place for snorkeling. A little inland near the northern end of the beach, there is a trail that leads across a lava field to a brackish-water pool, known as Queen’s Bath. It’s a spring-fed lava pool that some people use to rinse off after a swim in the ocean. To get here from the northern end of Honokohau Beach, walk approximately 600 feet (180 m) north until you reach a rock wall. From here, walk toward the mountains (toward the rock mounds) until you reach the pool, which is located right behind the rock mounds.   Honokohau is one of the many beaches that form the Kalolo-Honokohau National Historic Park. This 1160-acre (4.7 sq. km) park boasts some of the best archaeological sites and artifacts in the state, including ancient petroglyphs (rock carvings), temples, burial sites, trails, house platforms and three fishponds – Aiopio, Aimakapa and Kaloko – all of which is evidence that this area once supported a Hawaiian settlement of several hundred people.

Honoli'i Beach Park,"Located on the Big Island's east coast just north of Hilo, Honoli'i Beach Park is popular among the local surf crowd. Unlike most surfing beaches on the Big Island, Honoli'i sees action all year round. In the summer, the waves are relatively calm and ideal for beginning surfers. Winter is the season for the pros, where the surf gets higher and more challenging. A county lifeguard is on duty to keep an eye on the surfers. Rip currents are common on this beach, and the nearshore ocean bottom drops off quickly, so Honoli'i is mainly frequented by surfers, rather than swimmers. The beach itself is a mix of black sand, coral rubble, rocks and beach glass. Fishermen also frequent this beach, as do spectators, who often stand on the road above to watch the surfers.   The shore is a nice spot for picnics and relaxation. A dense grove of native trees grows along the area, providing lots of shade and privacy. The trees are lined up beside a small stream, a lesser-known but equally beautiful attraction. At the northern end of Honoli'i Beach, there is a pond at the mouth of the stream. The pond is a better area to swim than the rest of the beach itself, however, it is quite deep and drops off abruptly.

Honomalino Bay,"This secluded gray-sand beach on the Big Island's southwestern shore is a real gem. Fringed by coconut palms and kiawe trees, Honomalino Bay offers good swimming and snorkeling conditions when the ocean is calm. The beach is fronted by a shallow sandbar, which drops off sharply further out. The small bay is accessible via a 20-minute walk along a trail that begins at neighboring Miloli'i Beach Park.

Ho'okena Beach Park,"Ho'okena Beach Park, located on the Big Island's west shore, was once an important inter-island steamship landing site. In the early 1880s, Ho'okena grew into a busy trading village. It had a wharf, a school, courthouse and even a jail. Eventually, cars and trucks replaced steamers and by the mid-1930s, storms and high surf had destroyed the landing at Ho'okena and most villagers moved away from the shoreline and closer to the highway further inland. Ho'okena Beach is located at the northern end of Kauhako Bay, which is bordered by sea cliffs. The beach itself has fine, black detrital sand mixed with white sand, giving it a gray color. The shoreline is rocky, but there are a few sandy entry and exit points to get in and out of the water. The waters are generally calm here, but strong currents can occur during times of high surf.   On the shore, there are a number of trails that lead to tree groves, boulder formations and other interesting features. The area is a good spot for a picnic since there is a small coconut grove and a number of trees that provide shade.

Isaac Hale Beach Park,"Editor's Note: Due to a recent lava flow that occured on June 5, 2018, part of this beautiful beach was unfortunately destroyed. This page contains information prior to this event. Located on the eastern edge of Pohoiki Bay on the Big Island’s east shore, Isaac Hale Beach Park (see more photos) is a small two-acre (8,094 sq. m) park and is often times quite crowded. It is popular among picnickers, shoreline fishermen, surfers, campers and boaters. However, the swimming conditions are poor here due to strong currents and waves. There is a boat ramp which fishermen use to launch their boats (this is the only boat launch area in the entire Puna district). Local children can also be seen here using the boat ramp as a jumping point into the water. The Pohoiki Warm Springs, a small hot pond, is another attraction in this beach park and is surrounded by lush vegetation. To get there, walk for about two minutes (about 150 yards / 140 m) along the shoreline trail that begins to the right of the boat ramp. The pool is volcanically-heated and is located in a lava sink.   Water activities that are possible at Isaac Hale, besides fishing, include surfing and bodyboarding. The waves are best in the center of the bay, but a rip current is often times present here. Swimmers usually stick to the area around the boat ramp (and disregard the no swimming sign that stands here). The beach itself is composed of black sand and pebbles, but most surfers and swimmers use the boat ramp as en entry/exit point to the ocean.

James Kealoha Beach Park,"Named in 1963 after the first elected lieutenant governor of the state of Hawaii, James Kealoha Beach Park is also known as “4 Miles” among local residents – not because of its length, but because it is exactly 4 miles (6.4 km) from the Hilo Post Office, the main starting point for mileage markers in the area. When it comes to beach activities, this park offers the whole package: nice views, watersports, sunbathing and even a few good fishing spots. This makes James Kealoha Beach Park a convenient weekend stop for local families and visitors alike. But despite its popularity, the park never seems crowded since there’s a lot of open space.   Popular water activities at Kealoha include swimming, snorkeling, surfing, pole fishing and spearfishing. The central and western areas of the bay open up to the deeper offshore waters, so during times of high surf, a strong rip current runs seaward in this area. The surfing spot located here is aptly named “4 Miles.” The eastern end of the bay is more sheltered, and families with children prefer this area. There is a large, ponded swimming area that contains a few inlets and pockets of white sand. Behind the beach are trees that provide shade for picnickers. A picnic pavilion is also available. This area once belonged to the Carlsmith family, so sometimes the park is referred to as Carlsmith Park. Located offshore is Scout Island. On most maps it is referred to as Mahikea Island, yet, a few others claim its correct Hawaiian name is Peiwe. The island was hit by the tsunami in 1946, which shortened it on its seaward end. It used to be a popular summer camping site among the residents of Keaukaha, as well as a destination for the Big Island boy scouts (hence its English name “Scout Island”). The Hawaiian name Peiwe refers to drupe shells, whose snails were commonly eaten and are found throughout the Hawaiian Islands in shallow, rocky areas.

Kahalu'u Beach Park,"The Big Island has some outstanding underwater scenery, but Kahalu'u Beach Park (view panorama) on the island's west coast just south of Kailua-Kona stands out in particular. The fish here aren't at all wary of the swimmers, as they tend to be in other areas. Indeed, if you hang around long enough, some of them will come up to you and swim by your side. Over 100 species of fish can be observed here. The beach is one of the best snorkeling spots on the Big Island. In fact, many tourist maps refer to Kahalu'u as “Snorkel Beach.” Not only humans and colorful tropical fish love Kahalu'u Beach, but sea turtles as well. You’ll probably be able to see some in the water here.   The cove is ideal for novice swimmer and snorkelers as the water is almost always calm (except when there's a big storm or ocean swell coming in). That's because the beach is protected by a partially submerged rock wall, which keeps strong currents and larger waves out. Also, the water is very shallow in the cover, around neck deep in most spots and around 10 feet (3 m) in the deepest area. This is probably one of the reasons why the fish are so plentiful here. The sunlight can reach all the way to the bottom, which grows healthy corals and seaweed. The ocean bottom at Kahalu'u Beach Park has a mix of lava rock, corals and patches of sand. A little bit inland, many Hawaiian house ruins, heiaus and petroglyphs are located in the area, between the park and Keauhou Bay. The shoreline consists of white sand speckled with black lava fragments. It's best to get into the water via these sandy areas. During low tide, a few shallow tide pools surface, which can also be explored. During times of high surf, experienced bodyboarders and surfers venture out to the seaward edge of the reef in the outer area of the bay. A strong rip current may form during strong ocean swells in the area north from Kuemanu Heiau along the rugged shoreline rocks.

Kahuwai Bay,"Kahuwai Bay is a well-guarded secret of the Big Island diving community. The sandy beach is home to about 40 different diving sites, most of them within easy walking distance. The underwater lava rocks form beautiful archways and canyons that look almost surreal in the sunlight. There's also some interesting marine life here, most notably the green sea turtles that sometimes swim close to shore. The water is very shallow, so you don't even have to wade in to see them up close. One thing, however, that you can't get here is a leisurely swim. The only access to the water is via a sharp, slippery lava shelf, and the current can get out of control at times. There are also no lifeguards, so go diving only if you are very experienced and know your way around the bay.   The beach itself is a nice place to relax. There are palm trees lining the area, which provide shade for picnics and parties. The beach also offers nice views of the late afternoon sunset.

Kamakahonu Beach,"For a beach once inhabited by a king, Kamakahonu Beach (view panorama) on the Big Island of Hawaii is surprisingly calm and unflustered. Locals have nicknamed it ""Children’s Beach"" because of the gentle waves and shallow water. It is one of the safest swimming beaches in Kona. Nearby is the King Kamehameha Kona Beach Hotel, a popular place among vacationing families. Kamakahonu has a lot to offer for adults as well. It is an important historical site, having served as the final home of King Kamehameha the Great, who lived here from 1812 until his death in 1819. You can still find many of his old projects around; most of them are buildings and temples where he held office. His personal temple, the Ahuena Heiau, was built in the water and now sits a few yards off the shore.   Besides swimming, boating, snorkeling and fishing are also very popular activities here. Off the Kailua Pier, there are some good fishing spots. Also, you can rent canoes, paddle boats and fishing and snorkeling gear from the many beach shops on the shore. Kamakahonu has many beach facilities, such as restrooms, showers and BBQ areas. It’s a good beach for a picnic since there are shaded picnic spots along the shore. There are also a few fancy restaurants and concessions in the area, offering a nice mix of local and international cuisine. The name Kamakahonu means ""the turtle eye"" in the Hawaiian language. It is believed that the name originated from a rock, which was shaped like a turtle and which is now located under Kailua Pier.

Kapa'a Beach Park,"If you like your beaches small and private, you'll love this quiet rocky beach on the Big Island's northwestern shore. However, the shoreline here is rocky and the beach is not good for swimming. Kapa'a is mainly visited by picnickers, fishermen and divers. In the summer, the nearshore fishing conditions are good, but in the winter, heavy surf and strong currents make entering the ocean dangerous. The water is exceptionally clear here when the ocean is calm, and even though there is no coral reef to marvel at, the many colorful fish make up for it. In the old Hawaii, this remote area was well-populated and up until today, many habitation ruins surround the beach, such as yard walls, platforms and enclosures. Many of them are hidden under thick vegetation. Camping is allowed on the beach (but a permit is required) and is popular among backpackers.

Kauna'oa Bay (Mauna Kea Beach),"""Perfect"" has been used to describe Kauna'oa Bay (view panorama) on several occasions, and one look is enough to see why. Fringed with leafy palm trees and fine, golden sand, this beach is considered one of the island's best. White-sand beaches like this one are rare on the Big Island. It is no wonder that Kauna'oa Bay has consistently ranked among the top five beaches in the U.S. Stretching for about half a mile (800 m), the beach has two coral reefs and generally calm waters. The gently sloping shore at this cove is a good spot for sunbathing, but more adventurous visitors can try snorkeling along the rocky, southern side of the beach, where sea turtles, parrotfish, butterflyfish and other tropical fish can be spotted. However, during times of high surf, which is common in the winter months, a pounding shorebreak and strong rip currents can make entering the ocean hazardous.   Kauna'oa Bay fronts the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel and is therefore also known as Mauna Kea Beach. It is a public beach, but if you're not staying at the hotel, you'll have to get a beach access pass at the resort entrance gate. Tip: arrive early to ensure you're not turned away, as there are only 40 public parking spaces for beach visitors. Kauna'oa is one of the well-maintained beaches on the island. Most of the facilities can be found in or close to the hotel, and equipment rentals are available at several beachfront shops. For visitors who stick around after the sun has gone down, the hotel turns on floodlights over the water. These lights attract plankton, which in turn attract hungry manta rays. There's even a lookout called ""Manta Ray Point"" where one can get a good view of these interesting evening visitors. Two other smaller beaches can be accessed by walking for about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Kauna'oa - Wai'ula'ula Beach and Mau'umae Beach. Both are two small pockets of white sand.

Kealakekua Bay,"Few other spots have as much historical meaning as Kealakekua Bay (view panorama) on the Big Island's Kona Coast. This is where Captain James Cook (the British explorer who discovered the Hawaiian Islands in 1778) docked during his second voyage to the Hawaiian Islands in January 1779, and where he was tragically killed a month later in a conflict between his crew and the Hawaiians. In 1878, a 27-foot white obelisk was erected in his honor near the location where he was killed. But for most visitors, the real treasures are the coral reefs that slope beautifully from the shore into the water. The bay was declared a Marine Life Conservation District in 1969 as the coral reef is biologically significant. The reef is home to a large variety of fish and other sea creatures, many of which swarm close to shore. Needless to say, Kealakekua Bay is a favorite among snorkelers and scuba divers.   At the northern coastline is a sheer cliff (Pali-kapu-o-Keoua). On the cliff's face, many lava tube openings are visible, some of which are ancient Hawaiian burial caves. Within the bay, the Napo'opo'o area is shallow and has little coral, but the diving conditions improve farther out. The area between the Napo'opo'o landing and the southern tip of Manini Beach Point is the most beautiful in this area, featuring caves, crevices, ledges and spectacular corals in waters up to about 30 feet (9 m) deep. On the bay's northeastern side below the cliffs, the snorkeling conditions are good on calm days. There water here is about 5 feet (1.5 m) deep and is home to many corals and a variety of marine animals. The best diving can be done in Ka'awaloa Cove (near the Cook Monument) where depths range from about 5 to 120 feet (1.5 to 36.5 m). Here, the diversity of coral and fish is exceptional, and the fish are quite tame. Kayaking is also a popular activity. The bay stretches out for miles, and the water is calm and clear for most of the year. If you're lucky, you may even spot the curious spinner dolphins that visit the bay occasionally. A more common sight is the green sea turtle, a regular visitor at many Big Island beaches. To add to its historic charm, Kealakekua Bay maintains a mystic atmosphere that leaves visitors enthralled. Access to the beach is only via water or a long, rough footpath, which keeps it quiet and uncrowded on most days. Kealakekua Bay is about 1 mile (1.6 km) wide. The bay was settled over a thousand years ago, and there are many archaeological and historical sites in the surrounding area, such as heiaus (Hawaiian temples). The bay was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as the Kealakekua Bay Historical District. Since this is a Marine Life Conservation District, the following activities are prohibited: To fish for, take, or injure marine life (including eggs).
To take or alter any sand, coral, or other geological feature or specimen.
To engage or attempt to engage in fish feeding.
Note: anchoring of boats is prohibited in Subzone A. In Subzone B, anchors may only be dropped onto sand or in such a way as to avoid damage to coral.      ",,"swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, boating",Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/kealakekua-bay.php

Kehena Beach,"Located in the Big Island's Puna district, Kehena Beach is one of the few unofficial ""clothing optional"" beaches in Hawaii. It is a long, but narrow black-sand beach, which local residents also call Dolphin Beach because of the frequent appearances of spinner dolphins in this area. The beach was formed in 1955 when lava flowed down the sea cliffs and into the ocean here. At the eastern end of the beach, one can still see the tip of the lava flow (which is now a rocky point of land) that created the sand. In 1979, when a strong earthquake shook the Puna district, Kehena Beach dropped almost 3 feet (91 cm). The concrete stairs that led to the beach broke off and now hang more than 10 feet (3 m) above sea level.   The beach is well-shaded by coconut palms and ironwood trees, which make up the backshore. Swimming is possible here when the ocean is calm only because the beach is exposed to the open ocean and during times of high surf, strong rip currents and undertows can occur. That's why there have been quite a few near-drownings at Kehena in the past. Also, since this beach has many pebbles on the ocean bottom, they can easily get stirred up in the shorebreak during times of heavy surf, which can cause painful skin abrasions to people entering the water. So when the surf is up, it is best to stay out of the water and maybe have a picnic on the beach, which is accessible from the Kehena lookout.

All three beaches offer great opportunities for swimming, snorkeling and other beach activities. In the winter, there are also some good waves for surfing and bodyboarding. Coming from the south, the first beach is Mahai'ula Beach. It is accessible via a rugged dirt road (which begins between mile markers 91 and 90). A four-wheel drive is recommended, but regular cars can usually handle the road as well. There is a gate that is open from 9 am to 7 pm daily, except on Wednesdays when it is closed. You'll reach the beach after a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) drive and a 5-minute walk from the parking area.   Mahai'ula Beach is sandy and has a picnic area with tables. The ocean bottom drops off gently here and is composed of a mixture of sand and rocks. Besides swimming and snorkeling, many divers come here to explore the underwater arches, tunnels and caves, as well as a sunken ship. During times of high surf, many surfers come here as well. There is a good surf spot called Kawili Point at the northern end of the bay. Also, many ancient archaeological sites are located near Mahai'ula Beach, such as Pohaku o Lama, a stone fish goddess standing near the water's edge. In ancient Hawaii, fishermen brought their offerings to this rock and asked for their good luck at sea. In the spring time (May to June), the water around this rock sometimes turns red. The ancient Hawaiians believed that this meant that the stone goddess is menstruating. Nowadays, the scientific explanation is that the red water is caused by small organisms called dinoflagellates. The phenomenon can still be observed today. From Mahai'ula Beach, follow the coastal Ala Kahakai Trail that leads to neighboring Makalawena Beach, about a 15 to 20-minute walk. (It's a lava trail, so wear sturdy shoes). This white-sand beach is popular among local boys who like to bodysurf here in the winter. At the northern end of the beach is a small brackish water pond, which is inhabited by brine shrimp and nanini fish. From Makalawena Beach, the coastal trail leads north for about another 4 miles (6.4 km) to Kua Bay. Along the way, there are sand dunes, ponds and mini forests. About midway, hikers can walk to the summit of Pu'u Ku'ili, a 342-foot (104 m) high cinder cone. Kua Bay is a white-sand beach that also offers great conditions for a variety of water activities, such as swimming, snorkeling and diving. However, it can get quite hot here, especially in the summer months because there is no shade. If you don't plan to hike here from Mahai'ula Beach, Kua Bay is also accessible via a road that starts between mile markers 88 and 89. At the end of the road is a parking lot. But you'll have to walk over rough lava rocks to get to the beach.

Keokea Beach Park,"Located on the Big Island's rocky North Kohala shoreline, Keokea Beach is a boulder beach backed by sea cliffs. The swimming conditions are rather poor here because the bay is not protected by offshore reefs, so the surf is strong and the water rough on most days. Local residents have built a breakwater of boulders to improve the cove. There is a small stream in the park area where children can play, but make sure to keep an eye out so they don't stray off to the rocks. What it lacks in the water, Keokea makes up for on the coast. This beach has some of the best facilities in the area, including picnic tables, pavilions, fire pits, barbecue grills, restrooms and showers. The beach is a popular picnicking spot and gets crowded during the weekends and holidays.      ",,fishing,Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/keokeabeachpark.php
Kiholo Bay,"If you were to squeeze the Big Island into a single beach, you'll end up with something like Kiholo Bay (view panorama). This Kohala Coast beach has a little of everything: beautiful sights, fascinating wildlife, tide pools, ancient ponds and rock formations. There's even a mini-island made of lava rock right at the heart of the bay. The bay itself consists of a mix of fresh and salt water, surrounded by dark lava rocks and a usually calm lagoon. The lagoon is a great spot for swimming and snorkeling, since the water in it is usually calm compared to the rest of the bay. Much of the bay was once a Hawaiian fishpond built in 1820 by King Kamehameha I. Its boundaries were 2 miles (3.2 km) long and its rock walls were 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and 20 feet (6 m) wide. In 1859, a lava flow from the Mauna Loa volcano, located 30 miles (48 km) away from here, reached Kiholo Bay and destroyed the southern portion of the ancient fishpond and created the lagoon you see today.   At the northern end of the bay is Wainanali'i Pond, which is connected to the ocean via a man-made channel. It is an important feeding and sleeping site for green sea turtles. However, it is located on private property and therefore not accessible. Bordering Kiholo Bay to the south is Luahinewai Pond, a freshwater pool that's surrounded by coconut palms and lush vegetation. This area is also on private property and off-limits to visitors. On your way to Kiholo Bay, stop at Mile Marker #82 on Highway 19 at the Kiholo Bay Scenic Overlook, from where you can see most of the bay and its sprawling coastline (see below for directions on how to access the bay).

Kikaua Beach,"This small man-made cove (view panorama) has a pretty white-sand beach. The sandy ocean bottom within the cove is ideal for small children. The cove is surrounded by lava rocks which protect the nearshore waters from waves and currents. There are some palm trees on the beach which provide shade, and the beach is easily accessible via a 5-minute walk on a paved path. The beach closes a half hour after sunset.

Kolekole Beach Park,"Located about 10.5 miles (16.9 km) north of Hilo, Kolekole (see more photos) is a popular beach park among residents in the Hilo area, mainly because of its beautiful scenery, spacious grassy areas and facilities. On the weekends and on holidays, it is often times crowded with picnickers. The ocean conditions are too rough and dangerous for swimming, but many people use the Kolekole Stream as a swimming pool. The stream is fed by Akaka Falls, a popular waterfall located about 4 miles (6.4 km) above Honomu, a nearby town. Another smaller waterfall flows into Kolekole Stream near the ocean, completing the tropical scenery of this beach park.   Kolekole Beach is made up of black sand and rocks and is located below a 100 feet (30 m) tall highway bridge. The beach is small and during rough ocean conditions, high surf often times washes over the beach and into the stream. It is best to avoid swimming at the mouth of the stream due to strong currents in this area. The bridge was once used by the Hawaii Consolidated Railway. In 1946, a tsunami with waves of 37 feet (11 m) above sea level rushed onto the shoreline here and destroyed the girders from the middle part of the steel bridge, which destabilized it. Because many other parts of this part of the Big Island's shoreline were destroyed, the railroad went out of business. The county later purchased the bridge and rebuilt it.

Kua Bay (Manini'owali Beach),"Kua Bay (Manini'owali Beach) (view panorama) is part of the Kekaha Kai State Park, which is located along the leeward coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. It marks the northern end of the state park and features several hiking trails and a number of lookout points from which you can enjoy great views of the salt-and-pepper coastline. Swimming and snorkeling are popular activities in the summer, when the water is calmer. But even then there are days when novice swimmers shouldn't go into the water because the shorebreak can be very powerful and dangerous. It's what makes Kua Bay popular among bodyboarders and surfers. Another major attraction is the marine wildlife that thrives in the bay. On calmer days, you can see turtles and dolphins not far from shore. Some turtles actually swim up to the shore. Dolphins are a less common sight, but they do make frequent appearances in the summer months. Access to Kua Bay is easy. From the main highway, take the 1.5 mile paved road that leads to a parking lot. The parking lot fills up quickly during weekends, so people also park along the final stretch of the road. At the end of the road is a convenient turnaround.        ",,"swimming, snorkeling, diving, bodyboarding, surfing",Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/kuabay.php
Kuki'o Beach,"Located north of Kikaua Point on the Big Island's Kohala coast, Kuki'o Beach (view panorama) is a pretty white-sand beach, which can most conveniently be accessed at the Hualalai Four Seasons Resort. Entering the water is a little tricky here because shoreline rocks line almost the entire length of the beach. The best entry and exit point to the water is at the south end of the beach, where there is a small opening in the rocks, near neighboring Kikaua Beach. Because of this, Kuki'o Beach is not regarded as a good swimming beach. However, the fishing conditions are good. During the winter months, the waves are sometimes good enough for surfing and bodyboarding as well. The beach is surrounded by coconut palms, ironwood and kiawe trees.

Lapakahi State Historical Park,"Nature and history come together in this 265-acre (1 sq. km) park which is located a short drive north of Kawaihae on the Big Island's northwestern shoreline. Lapakahi State Historical Park was once an ancient Hawaiian fishing community, Koai'e, which dates back to the 14th century. The site features a wide array of historical artifacts, natural wonders and archaeological remains (such as old ruins, huts and temples), all of which stand as mute testaments to the island's fascinating history. Visitors can take a self-guided tour through the park. There is a mile-long trail that leads to several points of interest, which are all explained by markers. The tour ends at the Koai'e Cove, home to a marine preserve (Lapakahi Marine Life Conservation District) and two small but beautiful beaches. Beautiful coral reefs and interesting wildlife make for excellent underwater views, although snorkelers are advised to keep a safe distance from the coral. This is also a good spot for whale watching during whale season in the winter months. A short walk to the north lies Mahukona State Park, which is equipped with restrooms, showers and barbecue pits. Camping is allowed here with a permit.      ",,snorkeling,Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/lapakahi-state-historical-beach-park.php
Laupahoehoe Point Beach Park,"Located on the Big Island’s Hamakua Coast (east shore), Laupahoehoe Point (see more photos) is a peninsula covered with coconut palms, grass and black lava rocks on the shoreline, which contrast beautifully with the deep blue ocean. On a sunny day, the ocean is particularly blue here. Laupahoehoe is known for its scenic views, but it also holds a tragic past. It was here where a tsunami killed 19 schoolchildren and 5 adults on April Fool’s Day in 1946. The names and ages of the victims were engraved on a rock, which serves as a memorial in the park. The village was later relocated further inland to avoid another tragedy. Laupahoehoe Park is a nice spot for a picnic and picture taking, but when it comes to water activities, the options are limited. Other than exploring the nearshore tidepools, the ocean is too furious and dangerous here for swimming. When you’re out on the peninsula, you can often times see the waves crash against the lava rocks.      ",,fishing,Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/laupahoehoepointbeachpark.php
Leleiwi Beach Park,"Leleiwi Beach Park (see more photos) is located next to the Richardson's Ocean Center at the eastern end of Hilo. There is a small black-sand beach and the rocky shoreline is made up of a few natural ponds, inlets and small rock islets. Some of the ocean pools are fed by freshwater springs, so the surface water is a bit chilly. But nevertheless, many tropical fish and other marine life inhabit the bay. And because the beach is shallow and protected, it is a popular snorkeling destination.   A sea wall lines almost the entire length of the beach, but there is a small pocket beach at the base of the wall which serves as an entry and exit point to the water. As you enter the water, don’t be surprised if you’re joined by some green sea turtles who inhabit the area and are particularly friendly to swimmers. Keep in mind though that they are protected by law and it is not allowed to touch or swim after them. Leleiwi is also a good spot for picnics. There are palm trees that provide shade, as well as picnic tables and pavilions.     ",,"swimming, snorkeling, fishing",Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/lelewibeachpark.php
MacKenzie State Park,"This sprawling state park has one of the most dramatic oceanfronts, but people don't come here for the swimming. MacKenzie State Park is mostly popular among sunbathers, picnickers and fishing enthusiasts. Strong currents make it unsafe for swimmers and snorkelers, and many drownings and near-drownings have happened in this area. Most of them were fishermen who were swept off the rocky ledges. Nevertheless, the views at this 13-acre (52,609 sq. m) paradise certainly merit a full day of exploring.   The park is located on the east rift zone of Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes. Because of this, the park's landscape consists mostly of rocks and dried lava, with some lush greenery on the far sides. Low sea cliffs are located along the water's edge. Here, you'll find caves, sea arches and lava tube openings, most of them a result of decades of volcanic activity. The park is surrounded by many ironwood trees, so there is plenty of shade. Picnic tables and pavilions are available. If you want to stay overnight, you can get a camping permit from the park office. Be sure to check out King's Highway, an ancient Hawaiian trail that takes you through the park on a winding path. It was built back in the days when King Kamehameha the Great ruled the Hawaiian Islands. Along the way, there are several lookout points where you can enjoy great views of the ocean and surrounding landscape. The peak offers a bird's eye view of the coast, clearly defined against the water, making for a truly magnificent picture. MacKenzie State Park was named in 1939 after Albert J. W. MacKenzie, a forest ranger on the Big Island who passed away a year before. He was a dedicated forest ranger, replanting many burned areas in the Puna and Ka'u districts. He also planted the ironwood trees in this park. Another interesting fact is that MacKenzie State Park is known as a spooky place, especially at night. It is the nightmarchers' territory and eerie sounds and sights have been witnessed (Nightmarchers are the spirits of deceased ancient Hawaiians. Their processions, which include torches and drumming, have been witnessed by quite a few people, especially on full moon nights).

It is located about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of the Kona airport and is accessible via a rugged dirt road. This white-sand beach is backed by trees, which reach down almost to the water's edge, so there are some shady spots. The swimming conditions are usually good when the ocean is calm. From the beach, a coastal lava trail leads north to neighboring Makalawena Beach, about a 15 to 20-minute walk.      ",,swimming,Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/mahaiulabeach.php
Mahukona Beach,"Mahukona Beach is unusual in more ways than one. For one, it is not a real beach, but an abandoned commercial harbor run by the Kohala Sugar Company (the harbor was closed in 1956). Remnants of the area's enterprising past can still be found under water and are in fact one of its main attractions. The beach is not your typical Hawaiian paradise, but it's definitely got charm. The calm, clear waters make Mahukona a popular snorkeling spot. The underwater scene here is unique, featuring old mill equipment and machinery and even a shipwreck nestled inbetween beautiful coral reefs. Together, they make a most peculiar playground for the local marine life. Be sure to bring an underwater camera as this is one scene you certainly wouldn't want to miss!   There's also a lot to see on land, including several artifacts from the old sugar mill. The harbor edge is marked by a rock wall, and some rusted machinery has been here for years, adding to the rugged appeal of the place. The water is easily accessible from the harbor, but the shore is very rocky and can be hard to navigate. Bring a pair of sturdy sandals and save yourself a few scratches. The entrance is marked by gentle sloping steps, so there's no steep drop-off. The underwater visibility is usually excellent, except during times of rough ocean conditions (mainly during the winter months). During times of heavy surf, it is best to stay out of the water.

Makalawena Beach,"The Kona Coast has its share of ""secret"" beaches – little strips of paradise hidden by larger, better-known spots. Makalawena Beach is one such place, accessible by a 20-minute hike on a rough lava trail (or with a 4-wheel drive vehicle that can handle the bumps in the road). But anyone who has been here will agree that it is certainly worth the challenge. Makalawena's salt-and-pepper beach is a mix of white coral chunks and black lava, strewn with larger lava rocks that create an unusual, dramatic landscape. The beach is also unique in that some of the most extensive sand dunes in the Kona district are located here. The area immediately offshore is the best for swimming because the ocean bottom is the less rocky here than in the other coves and inlets of this beach. Make sure to check the water conditions before getting in, as the surf tends to be rough at times.   The Makalawena shore is lined by palm trees, and the beach has several coves and inlets, which are backed by a long, curving sand beach. Inland of the beach is the 12-acre (48,562 sq. m) Opae'ula Pond, which is one of the Big Island's most important shoreline bird sanctuaries. The pond is home to many opae'ula, or red shrimp, which are a delicacy for the birds. Some of the birds who can be seen here include the endangered Hawaiian stilt (a'eo), ducks, black-crowned night herons, coots, doves, sparrows, wandering tattlers and cardinals.

Manini Beach,"Located on the Big Island's west shore just south of popular Kealakekua Bay, Manini Beach has a rocky shoreline consisting of white coral rubble and black lava rocks. The beach wraps around the north point of Kahauloa Bay, and the area behind it belongs to Napo'opo'o Park. The surfing conditions are sometimes good here, especially if the waves break far enough out so that surfers can safely navigate away from the nearby rocks. Other water activities that are possible include snorkeling and scuba diving. There is a small sandy channel that cuts through the reef and allows for easy access into the ocean. The best underwater visibility can be found to the right of the channel. During rough ocean conditions, it is best to stay out of the water because it can get quite turbulent and this is when underwater visibility is diminished as well.   For those who prefer to stay out of the water, Manini Beach offers nice views of the Kealakekua cliffs and the Captain Cook monument. The beach is a nice picnic spot as well and picnic tables are available. The park has grassy areas and trees that provide shade. Manini Beach and the entire Napo'opo'o area were hit hard on March 11, 2011, when a tsunami (which was generated by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake in Japan) washed ashore here and caused extensive damage to many of the beach homes.

Napo'opo'o Beach Park,"A quaint historical charm surrounds the rugged landscape of Napo'opo'o Beach Park, a cultural gem on the Big Island's west shore, located at the southern end of Kealakekua Bay. This is where Captain James Cook first set foot on the Big Island of Hawaii on January 17, 1779, and where the first Christian service was held by his crew. Just across the bay is the exact spot where he was killed less than a month later (today a 27-foot white obelisk is standing near the spot where he was killed, which can be seen from Napo'opo'o Beach Park). Every step on this beach is a walk through time, and every stone has a story to tell. One of the highlights of this beach is the Hiki'au Heiau (ancient Hawaiian temple site), a temple dedicated to Lono, the god of agriculture and fertility of the land. When Cook arrived here in 1779, the natives initially thought he was Lono and that the large ships were newly formed islands. The heiau is accessible via a trail located behind the beach.   The shoreline is rocky, but walkable. What used to be a sandy beach has eroded over time. Now, mainly boulders make up the beach. Snorkeling at Napo'opo'o is good when the water is calm and clear. Like most beaches in the area, there is some interesting marine wildlife to observe, including green sea turtles. If you're lucky, you might spot some of them resting on the shore. Napo'opo'o is also a popular spot for picnics and barbecues. There's plenty of shade in this 6-acre (24,281 sq. m) beach park, and you can find grills and tables throughout the park. Update: The entire Napo'opo'o area were hit hard on March 11, 2011, when a tsunami (which was generated by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake in Japan) washed ashore here and caused extensive damage to many of the beach homes.

New Kaimu Black Sand Beach,"As the name of this beach implies, it is new. In fact, the land that this beach encompasses and the area surrounding it didn't exist a mere 20 years ago. In 1990, a lava flow from nearby Kilauea volcano reached the shoreline at Kalapana and destroyed this entire community along with the neighboring subdivisions of Kaimu and Royal Gardens. Also buried under 50-75 feet (15-23 m) of lava was Kaimu Black Sand Beach, a beach that was a favorite among local residents and visitors alike because of its fine, jet black sand and stately coconut palms lining the shoreline. In an effort to bring Kaimu Black Sand Beach back to its former glory, new palm trees have been planted on this brand new shoreline land. A small new black sand beach is located near where the old Kaimu Black Sand Beach used to be.   To reach it, drive Kapoho-Kalapana Road or Pahoa-Kalapana Road (Hwy 137 or Hwy 130) all the way to the end. There is a small parking lot near the Kalapana Village Café. From here, walk up the small hill where you'll see a sign that says “Kaimu Beach Eco-Path.” Follow the dirt trail that leads through the lava field. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to the ocean and the beach. There are no facilities out here, and water activities, including swimming, are not possible due to strong currents and hazardous surf.

Old Kona Airport State Park,"The old Kona Airport closed down in 1970, but developers have certainly put the site to good use. In its place now lies a one-mile-long beach and state park, the old runway conveniently turned into a parking lot. In fact, parking is one of the best facets of the Old Kona Airport Beach (see more photos) – it's free, the slots are wide and the lot can function as a picnic ground by itself. And the airport's old terminal building now serves as a pavilion. Many people come to Old Airport (as local residents refer to this state park) for the sunset views. The beach is long and wide, and there is a sandy stretch between the old runway and the rocks at the water's edge. Even though the beach is rather rocky, swimming is possible here.   The best spot is located at the southern end, where you'll find an inlet that offers easy access to the water. There are a few more inlets and sandy channels scattered on the length of the beach, but the southern end is the best one. This southern area around the old terminal building is leased by the county, and sports fields and tennis courts for community events are located here as well.

Onekahakaha Beach Park,"Located just south of downtown Hilo on the Big Island’s east shore, Onekahakaha Beach Park is the ideal beach for families with small children and for tidepooling. There is a sand-bottomed cove that is separated from the open ocean by a boulder break, so the nearshore waters are shallow and free of currents or wave action. Also, lifeguards are on duty year-round. Surrounding the cove are a few tide pools, which are sometimes visited by sea turtles. The largest one of them is home to a large population of sea urchins, as well as sea cucumbers, brittle stars, cone shells, sea urchins and sea anemones. However, this pool is not as children-friendly as it has a rockier and deeper bottom and is not protected by the breakwater. Also, it is subject to currents.   Behind the breakwater, the currents are strong especially when the surf it up, so in the past, when there weren’t any lifeguards yet, many drownings and near-drownings have happened in the turbulent waters behind the protected area. When tidepooling, keep the following safety tips in mind: Always wear water shoes to protect your feet from the sharp lava rocks and reef. Don’t touch the sea urchins or other ocean creatures.

The beach is rocky and there is a low seawall at the water's edge, which acts as a barrier against high waves. There is only a small pocket of sand mixed with coral rubble, so it is not a good beach for swimmers. However, Pahoehoe makes up for it by being a nice spot for a picnic or ball games. The park is shaded by kiawe trees and has grassy areas and picnic tables.   When the ocean is calm experienced snorkelers and scuba divers frequent Pahoehoe because it offers some interesting underwater sights, such as ancient lava formations, colorful marine life and a beautiful coral reef.

Papakolea Green Sand Beach,"Papakolea Beach, located near the Big Island's southern tip, is known for its unique olive green sand. Olivine is a semi-precious stone. Here in this area these small green volcanic stones originate from the littoral cone that surrounds the small bay. The ocean erodes these stones and crushes them into fine sand. The sand is too fine to be considered gem stones, but beaches like this are rare. So it's almost like walking on jewels. However, getting to this beach isn't easy. Papakolea is located at the base of Pu'u O Mahana, an old littoral cone in a wild, undeveloped terrain. Access involves a three-mile (4.8 km) hike through lava fields. If you're going on a sunny day, keep in mind that it is usually quite windy in this area, which blows up the dust.   It is a good idea to prepare yourself for what some call a long and arduous walk. So wear hiking boots, a T-Shirt, comfortable pants or shorts and a hat and bring plenty of water and sunscreen. It is a common sight to see tourists arrive in sandals and bathing suits who turn around half way because they can't make it. Also, there aren't any signs, markers or maps to follow. There isn't even a specified trail. A good tip is to stay a little bit more to the left on the way there. Even though the trails near the ocean are nice, they are more rugged with sharp lava rocks and in the end will take longer. Once you make it to the beach, you'll be rewarded with one of the best views on the Big Island. The green beach appears almost unreal against the backdrop of steep cliffs and boulders. At sunset, the play of colors against the sand is simply breathtaking. To get down to the beach, you'll have to hike down a low sea cliff. The best spot is the area where the cliff is less steep. The steep face of the cliff is dangerous because the ground is loose and can slide away. The sparkling blue water appears calm, but beware that currents are often times difficult to spot, so it is best to stay close to the shore if you plan to swim here. If the surf is up, don't go into the ocean because if you get in trouble here, you're miles away from any help. There are no lifeguards on this beach. A visit to Papakolea Beach is a full-day trip, so plan ahead. The hike to and from the beach alone takes about 2-3 hours, depending on how fast you can walk, and then you still need to calculate for some time on the beach and the drive time it takes to get to South Point. It is best to leave the beach well before sunset because as mentioned above, the area is undeveloped, there are no lights and the terrain is rough. It is not a good idea to walk here in the dark.

Pauoa Bay,"From the shore, Pauoa Bay (view panorama) looks like a small pond with the crescent-shaped lava walls protecting the calm blue waters. Palm trees line the coast and rugged greenery grows on the large rocks that surround the bay. The natural seawalls keep out high surf, making the bay calm and perfect for swimming and snorkeling. Experienced divers and surfers sometimes venture beyond the walls to get some wave action, but most people prefer to stay in the safe zone. On calm days, you can also go rafting or boating around the bay. Pauoa Bay is home to one of the healthiest coral reefs in Hawaii, thanks mostly to conservation efforts by the University of Hawaii. Here you'll find the beloved honu (Hawaiian green sea turtle) and a large population of reef fish, including eels, rays, puffer fish and butterflyfish. In the winter, you may even spot a few dolphins and whales. Pauoa Beach is located in front of the Fairmont Orchid at Mauna Lani Resort. The resort unofficially doubles as a parking lot for its beachgoing patrons.       ",,"swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving",Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/pauoabay.php
Pebble Beach,"Located on the Big Island's Kona Coast, Pebble Beach gets its name from the black lava pebbles that line its coast, creating a unique and attractive landscape. The beach is home to a rich marine ecosystem. Just below the surface, there is a wide array of ridges, pinnacles and reefs, all teeming with fish and other native marine life. Some of these ridges lead to steep drop-offs. Even though this sounds like the perfect snorkeling or diving spot, the shorebreak is treacherous here and strong currents are almost always present. The beach is also not the best place to sit down for a picnic because there is no sand and the pebbles can get quite hot during mid-day and are not too comfortable to sit on. But it's still an interesting place to visit to listen to the surf wash ashore and toss the pebbles around.      ",,none,Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/pebblebeach.php
Pelekane Beach,"Pelekane Beach (see more photos, view panorama) on the Big Island's South Kohala Coast isn't your typical beach park. In fact, swimming, picnicking, camping and even sunbathing isn't allowed on this beach because many ancient sacred sites are located here. But a visit is definitely worth it because you'll learn about Hawaii's past and can see traditional heiaus (Hawaiian temple sites), some of which were used by King Kamehameha the Great. One such heiau, located near Pelekane Beach, is the Pu'ukohola Heiau dedicated to the war god Ku and built by the king himself in 1790-91. Pelekane Beach has also witnessed a large number of human sacrifices, which were part of ancient Hawaiian rituals. The first such sacrifice was made during the dedication ceremony for the newly erected temple and was followed by several others over the course of several years. The king's cousin and rival, Keoua, also met his end on this beach, marking the start of Kamehameha's reign. Mailekini Heiau, which is directly located on Pelekane Beach, is much smaller than the great Pu'ukohola, but is one of the oldest and bears several ancient religious images.   Then there is another smaller heiau believed to be completely submerged about 100 feet (30 m) offshore. It's a shark heiau called Hale o Kapuni, dedicated to the shark god Kauhuhu. It is said that human remains were placed here for the sharks. Up until this day, a large shark population frequents this area. Local residents consider the area a breeding ground for sharks, mainly black tips and grays. The beach itself is small and consists of white sand and coral rubble. The ocean bottom is very shallow here because of the coral rubble, soil runoff from the shore and rocks from the nearby harbor landfill. The water is almost stagnant and appears dirty. Because of this and the sharks it doesn't really matter that swimming is prohibited here. Two signs near Pelekane Beach read: ""Who would suspect that the area at the base of this hill is one of the most significant cultural sites in Hawaii? This plain-looking patch of earth was the site of Pelekane, one of several known royal compounds traditionally used by Hawaiian kings. The compound contained the royal residence, probably some housing for other members of the royal court, and a royal fish pond. It was at Pelekane where Keoua, rival to Kamehameha, was killed in 1791, securing Hawaii for Kamehameha and initiating his takeover of all the Hawaiian Islands. Here, too, Kamehameha II prepared for his role as king following his father's death in 1819. Pelekane also became a favorite landing spot for foreign ships, where trade negotiations with the king were often hosted. After 1819, it is probable that, like Pu'ukohola Heiau and the ancient religious beliefs, the royal compound was abandoned with the abolition of the kapu (sacred laws)."" ""The submerged remains of Hale o Kapuni Heiau, a temple dedicated to shark akua (deities), are believed to be just offshore. The heiau was built by a chief whose family revered sharks, believing that the family's 'aumakua (deified ancestors) could become physically present within sharks. A Hawaiian family often revered a specific animal species, in the belief that the spirit of a helpful ancestor might appear to them as one of that species during times of distress. The exact construction date and exact location of Hale o Kapuni Heiau are unknown. It is hoped that underwater archaeology will tell us more. The National Park Service strives to protect all cultural resources, whether on land or submerged.""

Pine Trees Beach,"Unlike its name, you won't find any pines on this beach – it was named by clueless surfers who thought the nearby mangroves were pine trees. Pine Trees Beach is a popular place among local surfers and one of the best barbecue sites on the Big Island's Kona Coast. The beach is mainly visited by local residents because it's not that easy to get to it. Access is via a rough, unpaved, 4-wheel drive road. It can be crowded on weekends, but during the week, you may have it almost to yourself. Locals often camp out here, but you’ll need a permit to stay overnight. You can get one from the beach officials who usually set up a tent on the beach. The swimming conditions are poor because the ocean bottom is rocky. It is mainly surfers who go into the water. But the beach has white sand, so it's a good place for a barbecue and to relax. When the water is calm, the deeper offshore areas are sometimes visited by scuba divers, who come here on boat. The area offers good cave-diving opportunities.      ",,"surfing, scuba diving",Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/pinetreesbeach.php
Pololu Valley Beach,"You might feel a sense of déjà-vu when visiting Pololu Valley Beach (see more photos). Your hunches are probably right – this beach is one of the most photographed spots on the Big Island. You’ve probably seen it on postcards, book covers and in magazines and brochures. The small black-sand beach is surrounded by high sea cliffs, which look like giant walls. Some visitors just come to the Pololu Valley Lookout. The valley itself is a steep 400 feet (122 m) down, accessible on foot, but quite a challenge for inexperienced hikers. It takes about 25 minutes to get to the beach and you’ll have to walk down steep steps on a zigzagging dirt path.   However, the view is well worth it. You’ll come across a lazily winding stream, emerald-green landscapes and a few little waterfalls. It’s no surprise that people have fondly called this valley an enchanted forest – you can almost feel the magic in the air! The swimming conditions are poor here because of strong currents and the rocky ocean bottom. There are no lifeguards or facilities nearby, so make sure to plan ahead and bring everything you need. You’ll need to hike all the way back up to load up on supplies! Also, make sure to bring insect repellent, as the area tends to attract mosquitoes.

Puako Bay,"Puako Bay (view panorama) on the Big Island's northwestern coast has a rocky shoreline with many tide pools, inlets and coves, which offer good snorkeling conditions when the ocean is calm. A long, but narrow white-sand beach spans almost the entire length of the bay. Due to the nearshore rocky ocean bottom, Puako Bay is not a good area for swimming. The bay is mainly frequented by scuba divers because of the bay's vast reef. Puako is also known for being home to the largest collection of petroglyphs in the state. The petroglyphs (ancient rock drawings) depicting life in prehistoric Hawaii hold a deep cultural value. Over 3,000 of these drawings can be found at the Puako Petroglyph Archaeological Preserve, each one with a story to tell. A trail leads from Holoholokai Beach to the petroglyph site.

Punalu'u Black Sand Beach,"Black sand beaches can be found all over the Big Island of Hawaii, but Punalu'u Beach (see more photos), located on the island's southeast shore, is the most popular and one of the most beautiful. This beach is easily accessible and boasts a shore of shiny, jet black sand, made up of ground lava rocks. It was created by a'a lava flowing into the ocean. The area is a well-known nesting place for hawksbill and green sea turtles, both endangered species and the target of many conservation efforts. On a regular day, the shore is dotted with large sea turtles playing and catching some sun. A word of warning, however: these turtles are not to be touched, as they have no immune system to protect them against human-transmitted bacteria. Visitors are required to keep a 15-foot (4.5 m) distance from the turtles at all times.   At one end of the beach is a natural freshwater pool perfect for wading and cooling down. Further offshore, there are numerous underground freshwater springs, which are very cold and mix with the ocean water. In the past, the people who lived in this area would dive underwater with bottles to obtain freshwater. They pressed their fingers on the water bottles, dove down, and when they reached the freshwater springs, they removed their fingers and filled the bottles. In the Hawaiian language, Punalu'u means “diving spring.” Legend has it that anyone who takes a stone from this beach will be cursed by the volcano goddess Pele and be forgiven only when the stone is returned. However, while this is supposedly an ancient Hawaiian legend, historians were only able to trace the origins of this legend to the mid-twentieth century. It is believed that park rangers invented it to prevent visitors from taking rocks and sand home. Nevertheless, if you visit the lobby of the Kilauea Military Camp, you'll see a cabinet where rocks are displayed that have been mailed back to Hawaii by people who had taken them and who were haunted by bad luck ever since. Their letters explaining their predicaments are on display as well. In the past, Punalu'u has suffered severe erosion by the ocean. In 1868, a huge tsunami that was caused by an earthquake struck the area. Waves as high as the coconut trees suddenly rolled in and leveled every shoreline village from South Point to Kumukahi. The residents later rebuilt the village at Punalu'u and in the 1880s, a pier was built to move the harvested sugar cane from the surrounding plantations via interisland steamships. But when more roads were built and automobiles were available to transport goods, the Punalu'u shipping point was abandoned and Hilo became the Big Island's main port. The area was hit by two other tsunamis in 1960 and 1975. The best part to enter the ocean at Punalu'u is at the northeastern end of the beach because there are fewer lava rocks at the water's edge. There is also a small boat ramp in this area, next to the ruins of the old pier. Swimmers should keep in mind that there is a strong rip current that runs out the boat channel into the open ocean. So it is best to stay away from the northeastern point of the bay.    ",,swimming,Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/punaluublacksandbeach.php
Reeds Bay Beach Park,"Located on Banyan Drive (the road along which most of the hotels in Hilo are located), Reeds Bay Beach Park offers a calm and shallow swimming area. However, most people prefer another area called Ice Pond, which is located at the head of Reeds Bay. This natural pond got its name from the cold spring water that bubbles up from the ocean bottom and mixes with the salt water.

The bay consists of white sand and coral rubble (the western edge of Reeds Bay is man-made). Between 1925 and 1930, coral material was dredged at Hilo Harbor and deposited here. Sailboats anchor in the waters offshore, and other smaller boats are launched from shore.

The beach park is named after William H. Reed, a prominent businessman on the Big Island who arrived here in the 1840s and died in 1880.       ",,"swimming, boating, fishing",Hawaii,https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/reedsbaybeachpark.php
Richardson Beach Park,"Also known as Richardson Ocean Center, this park has calm waters, excellent snorkeling conditions, lots of shade and several tide pools where children can play away from the surf. The water is accessible through a small black-sand beach at the edge of the park. From here, you can go swimming, surfing or kayaking, depending on the weather. Natural seawalls made out of lava create natural pools and coves, which keeps the water calm. There’s usually some good surf further offshore, although beginners are not advised to go too far.   Snorkeling is one of the most popular activities here, especially in the summer season. When you get in, you’ll be able to observe an abundance of tropical fish that live in and around the coral reef. If you’re lucky, you may even spot a green sea turtle.

Road to the Sea Black Sand Beach,"The Road to the Sea, located on the Big Island's southwestern coast, is one that's hardly traveled, and it's easy to see why. The six-mile (9.7 km) trail is dotted with sharp lava rocks, surrounded by steep ledges and riddled with cracks and potholes. But those who make it here are well-rewarded, for at the end of this path lie a few black and green sand beaches that are surrounded by nothing but black lava rocks. On a sunny day, the coast looks picture-perfect with its greenish sand, deep blue waters and the surrounding black cliffs. But getting here is definitely an adventure in itself. The first 3 miles (4.8 km) of the road are doable even in a regular car, but after that the road is rough and steep in places, so a four-wheel drive vehicle is necessary to navigate it (or you can park here and hike the final 3 miles to the beach).   It's commonly called the Road to the Sea Black Sand Beach, but there are actually two beaches at the end of the road. Neither has an official name, but both are known for their black and green sands. The green comes from crushed olivine crystals, a less-polished variety of peridot. It is a semi-precious gemstone, brought to the surface by past volcanic activity and the erosive force of the ocean. The ancient Hawaiians considered olivine (green sand) to be the tears of the volcano goddess Pele, and they used the green sand in healing ceremonies. The sand pieces are too small to be considered gemstones, but occasionally a lucky beachgoer finds a bigger piece. The two beaches are fairly small, between 50 and 100 feet (15-30 m) long. The green sand has a slightly darker hue here than at Papakolea Beach (near South Point), which is the most popular green-sand beach on the Big Island. There are no lifeguards in this area, so if you want to swim, snorkel or surf, keep in mind that the ocean bottom drops off quickly and strong currents can be present, especially during times of high surf. Fishing is a popular activity here, especially in the spring and summer when the fish swim closer to shore. The main catch is ulua.

Spencer Beach Park,"Located south of Kawaihae Harbor on the Big Island's northwestern coast, Spencer Beach Park (see more photos, view panorama) offers excellent swimming and snorkeling conditions, ample shade under large native trees and a calm, friendly atmosphere. The park is named after Samuel M. Spencer, former chairman of the Hawaii County Board of Supervisors who was responsible for developing the north Kohala Coast. Spencer Beach is one of the few white-sand beaches on the Big Island. The soft, smooth shore offers a comfortable change from the usually rocky beaches on the Big Island, making it a great picnicking spot. A long, shallow reef offshore keeps out high waves and strong currents. The water near the shore is shallow and an excellent playground for kids. Surfing is not very popular, as the water is usually calm.   The park is ideal for weekend picnics as there are lots of facilities, including a large picnic pavilion complete with tables and electrical outlets. Camping is allowed on the grounds, but you’ll need a permit to stay overnight (see Big Island camping for info on how to get a permit). If you're up for a walk, consider going to the adjacent Pu'ukohola Heiau, which was built by King Kamehameha I in 1790-91.

Waialea Bay (Beach,"Waialea Bay (view panorama) is one of the few beautiful white-sand beaches on the Big Island of Hawaii. Many local families come here with their children. The summer months are mostly calm and perfect for swimming and snorkeling. The ocean bottom drops off gradually and reaches depths of around 30 feet (9 m) just outside of the bay. Below the surface, you'll find several coral colonies around large underwater rocks. Lots of colorful fish live in the area. The water is less friendly in the winter and since there are no lifeguards on duty, it may be best to stay on the shore and watch the waves. When the surf is up, surfers and bodyboarders are drawn to a surf break at the northern point of the bay.   Waialea Beach is also known as Beach 69 among local residents. Visitors may chuckle at this name and wonder why it's called like that. The reason is because the public utility pole that's standing at the road that leads to the beach is number 69.

Waipi'o Beach,"Waipi'o Valley has been called the Valley of the Gods and one look at this secluded place is all it takes to see why. The lush valley is home to ancient sacred temples, tropical rainforests and tall sea cliffs rising 2,000 feet (610 m). Indeed, few places on the island can match the spiritual energy and mystical charm of Waipi'o. It is one of the most popular and beloved locations in all of Hawaii. Access to Waipi'o Beach is somewhat difficult, as the road to the valley is narrow and very steep. It is one mile (1.6 km) long and descends 1,000 feet (305 m). It hugs the cliff and even though it is paved, one needs a four-wheel drive vehicle to navigate it. You may want to consider walking it instead of driving because once you're on your way in your car, it is impossible to turn around in case you change your mind. The road begins at the Waipi'o Valley Lookout.   A black-sand beach lines almost the entire length of the shoreline of the valley. Even though the beach looks beautiful, entering the ocean here can be dangerous due to rip currents and high surf, especially during the winter months. There are a few accessible waterfalls to the south, such as Kaluahine Falls and Waiulili Falls. The valley itself is hardly populated, but signposts have been put up to mark the sacred and private areas. You may also come across some wild horses who live in the valley. The trail to the beach is public, but much of the valley is private property. Hikers who plan to explore the valley should keep this in mind and ask for permission.

White Sands Beach Park,"Even though this beach is on the small side, it's got four names: White Sands Beach, La'aloa Beach Park, Magic Sands and Disappearing Sands (view panorama). During times of high surf (usually in the winter months), an interesting natural phenomenon occurs here. The shorebreak erodes the small pocket of white-sand beach very quickly, often times within 24 hours, washing away all sand and leaving only exposed lava rock. That's why this beach is also called Disappearing Sands because it quite literally vanishes. When the wave action ceases, the regular ocean currents slowly move the sand back. However, this can take a few months. But this periodic and complete flushing of the sand keeps it very white. Other than that, White Sands Beach is not particularly impressive. The Big Island is known for beaches with colors other than white, which makes a small white-sand beach like this one special. It is located next to a street in a busy area and surrounded by buildings. But it is easy to reach as it is located just south of Kailua-Kona. On the shore are a few coconut palms, and lava rocks frame both ends of the beach.   The bodyboarding and surfing conditions are often times great, so when the surf is up you’ll see many people in the water here. In fact, this beach is one of the most popular bodyboarding locations in the area. The nearshore ocean bottom is mainly sandy and slopes gradually. The swimming conditions are good when the waves are not too high, but during rough ocean conditions, the strong shorebreak is dangerous and a strong rip current can pull swimmers into the open ocean.

We are leaving this page up for all of us who have made memories here and would like to remember it as it used to be. Located on the Big Island’s east shore near Pahoa, Ahalanui Park (see more photos) (also known as Pualaa County Park) offers a bathing experience that is unique in the Hawaiian Islands. Here you can have a bath in a spring-fed, walled-in pool, which is volcanically heated to a comfortable 90°F (32°C). On some days though the water is a bit cooler than that. The part natural part man-made pool is located right next to the ocean. It is connected to it by a small inlet, which also allows small tropical fish to enter the pool. The pool water is brackish, but crystal clear, and the bottom of the pool is a combination of sand and mud, with a slight sulfur smell.   Ahalanui Park is a good place for novice swimmers since the water is shallow and there is even a lifeguard. A few access ladders make getting into the pool easy. It is a beautiful spot, surrounded by palm trees, grass and shady areas, ideal for picnics. Note: Avoid swimming at Ahalanui Pond with an open wound or cut. The pond was closed to the public on September 26, 2013, after a man contracted an infection after swimming in the pond with an open wound. The County reopened Ahalanui Park in early October after water testing by the state Department of Health showed bacterial levels safe for swimming. According to the Health Department, there was no evidence to suggest the pond water being contaminated.

Kapoho Tide Pools,"Editor's Note: Due to a recent lava flow that occured on June 5, 2018, this beautiful destination was unfortunately destroyed. We are leaving this page up for all of us who have made memories here and would like to remember it as it used to be. Located on the Big Island's east shore at Kapoho Bay, the Kapoho Tide Pools (see more photos) offer a unique outdoor bathing experience. There are numerous and interconnecting tide pools that extend up to 200 yards (183 m) offshore. Many of them are large and deep enough to provide enough room for swimmers and snorkelers. Some of the pools are volcanically heated and quite warm, up to about 90 degrees F (32.2 C). In the outer pools near the surf break, a wide variety of sea life can be seen, such as fish, crabs, shellfish and sea cucumbers. However, it is best to stay away from the surf line and further inshore because strong rip currents are common further out. The inner pools are almost always calm (except during periods of strong surf and storms) and are a good area for snorkeling, since the water here is clear and protected. During calm days, the fishing conditions are good at the edge of the reef. This is also the time when scuba divers explore the outer edges of the reef, which they access via boat from offshore.   The entire shoreline consists of black lava rocks, which is rough and sharp. There is no sand at all. So it is best to wear protective shoes to access the area and also when swimming in the tide pools. Reef shoes are ideal. A few beach homes line the shore and some residents have incorporated some of the smaller pools at the outer edges into their property to use as swimming pools and ""hot"" tubs, so make sure you don't go dipping in a pool that is located on private property. Kapoho is an old village that was destroyed by a lava flow in 1960. All that was spared was a lighthouse at Cape Kumukahi (accessible by driving straight ahead on Highway 132, a dirt road, where Highway 137 intersects Highway 132). A new community has been rebuilt on Kapoho Bay. The community that's closest to the lighthouse is called Kapoho Beach Lots (a gated community). To the south is the public access community called Vacationland. Fronting Vacationland are many public access tide pools. This oceanfront area has been designated the Wai'opae Tidepools Maring Life Conservation District in 2003. This means that commercial fishing or guided tours are not allowed here. The name ""Kapoho"" means ""the depression"" in the Hawaiian language, referring to the many salt-water-filled depressions (tidal pools) in the area.
